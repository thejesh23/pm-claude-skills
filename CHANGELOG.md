# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project broadly follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):
each new wave of skills bumps the **major** version, extensions and fixes bump
**minor** / **patch**.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Multi-platform export generator.** `scripts/build-exports.mjs` renders every skill
  into platform-ready files under `exports/` from a single source of truth (the
  `SKILL.md` body), so content is never maintained twice. Ships **ChatGPT**
  (`exports/chatgpt/.../SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`) and **Google Gemini**
  (`exports/gemini/.../GEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) exports, plus a `PLATFORMS` registry that
  makes adding Cursor/etc. a few lines. Includes a `--check` mode and a
  `check-generated` CI workflow that fails if exports or `web/skills.json` drift.
- **Programmatic helpers (stdlib Python) for three flagship skills.** Each runs with
  zero dependencies and computes part of the work instead of estimating by hand:
  - `sprint-planning/scripts/capacity_calculator.py` — recommended sprint commitment
    from team size, availability, velocity, and carry-over (caps at 80% of velocity).
  - `rice-prioritisation/scripts/rice_calculator.py` — calculates and ranks RICE
    scores from JSON/CSV and auto-flags quick wins, moonshots, and low-confidence items.
  - `cs-health-scorecard/scripts/health_score.py` — weighted health total out of 100
    with RAG banding and weight validation.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — this file, back-filled from the release history.
- **`SKILL-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md`** — the canonical structure every SKILL.md follows
  (frontmatter, required sections, quality bar, anti-patterns).
- **Skill tiers** — a `TIERS.md` reference and README section marking skills as
  **Production-Ready**, **Stable**, or **Experimental** so new users start with the
  strongest work.
- **Cross-tool compatibility** — README now documents which platforms the skills work
  on (Claude Code natively; the SKILL.md bodies port to other agents and chat LLMs).
- **Related Projects** — README section linking to other community Claude Skills
  libraries and the `awesome-claude-skills` / `awesome-claude-code` lists.
