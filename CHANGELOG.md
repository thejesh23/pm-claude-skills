# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project broadly follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):
each new wave of skills bumps the **major** version, extensions and fixes bump
**minor** / **patch**.

## [Unreleased]

## [29.0.0] — Multilingual + a polished experience — 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Multilingual output** — run any of the 207 skills in **10 languages** (Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic, Portuguese, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Indonesian; English default) via a language selector in the playground. The frameworks are language-agnostic, so the model localizes the whole output; the choice persists, and **RTL scripts (Arabic) render right-to-left**. Applied to the plain side of Compare too.
- **The Practical Guide** — a 15-page, example-driven manual ([`web/guide.html`](web/guide.html) → [`PM-Skills-Guide.pdf`](web/docs-assets/PM-Skills-Guide.pdf)): install, anatomy of a skill, three worked examples (PRD, exec update, RICE), chaining recipes, the Brain, running anywhere, and tips.
- **One-page cheatsheet** — [`CHEATSHEET.md`](CHEATSHEET.md) + a printable poster ([PNG](web/docs-assets/cheatsheet.png) / [PDF](web/docs-assets/cheatsheet.pdf)); both PDF covers carry the Product Notes logo.
- **Proof of ROI** — [`CASE_STUDIES.md`](CASE_STUDIES.md) (before→after time-saved template) + a "Share an ROI story" issue form.
- **Opt-in usage feedback** — a 👍/👎 bar after each playground run (anonymous event + a prefilled GitHub issue for "what I'd change"; never inputs/outputs/keys).

### Changed
- **Navigation & playground UX revamp** — an always-visible **GitHub repo link** in the toolbar (there was no way back to the repo), a **sticky** toolbar, the **Product Notes logo now links home**, plus a redesigned playground home (bigger hero, stat chip-cards, rounded controls, even card grid). Fixed a sticky-bar overlap and stale skill counts (→ 207).

### Quality
- **Eval regression gate** — the PR check now **fails if a changed skill's score drops** vs. main, so quality can't quietly rot as models change.

> Builds on the **v28.x** wave (not previously changelogged): the **Professional Brain** — a local-first markdown memory skills read, write back to (provenance-tagged, approval-gated), and act on via [`action-runner`](skills/action-runner/SKILL.md) — now also **in the browser**; the **n8n / Lovable / Obsidian** integrations + a read-only **REST API**; and a free, **no-credit-card** playground (Gemini free key / in-browser WebLLM).

## [28.1.0] — Integrations: n8n, Lovable & Obsidian + a REST API — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **REST API on the hosted Worker** (`mcp-remote/`) — a read-only, no-auth, CORS-open JSON API under `/v1` (`/v1/skills`, `/v1/skills/{name}` with `?format=md`, `/v1/search`, `/v1/workflows`) so HTTP / no-code tools can use the library without speaking MCP. Same catalogue as the MCP connector.
- **n8n integration** ([`connectors/n8n.md`](connectors/n8n.md)) — MCP Client node (zero-build) and HTTP Request node recipes, plus an importable example workflow ([`connectors/n8n-example-workflow.json`](connectors/n8n-example-workflow.json)).
- **Lovable integration** ([`connectors/lovable.md`](connectors/lovable.md)) — client-side BYO-key and Supabase edge-function patterns, plus a paste-in knowledge snippet that makes Lovable's generator skill-aware.
- **Obsidian integration** ([`connectors/obsidian.md`](connectors/obsidian.md)) + a new **`obsidian` export target** — all 205 skills regenerate as vault-ready notes ([`exports/obsidian/`](exports/obsidian/)) usable as Copilot-for-Obsidian / Text Generator / Templater prompts. 10 export platforms total.
- **Worker deploy Action** ([`.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml)) — auto-deploys `mcp-remote/` to Cloudflare on changes (with a post-deploy `/v1` smoke test), so the REST API stays live without a manual `wrangler deploy`.

## [23.0.0] — 180 Skills + the Ask Experience — 2026-06-21

A milestone release (crossed 1,000 ⭐): the library turns into a developer Q&A surface.

### Added
- **Five developer skills** (bundled in `pm-engineering`, 38 → 43): **error-decoder** (decode an error/stack trace), **regex-builder** (build/explain regex with tests), **git-troubleshooter** (safe commands to undo a git mess), **dependency-conflict-resolver** (version-hell, ranked by safety), **code-explainer** (plain-English walkthrough). Library is now **180 skills**.
- **Ask** (`ask.html`) — a coding question routed to the best developer skill and answered instantly ("StackOverflow, but the answer's already written"), with a one-click path to the community Q&A.
- **Q&A Discussions** template + an ❓ Ask nav tab.
- **Eval cases for the 5 new skills** — eval coverage 15 → **20 skills**.

### Fixed
- Registered the new skills across all manifests (`marketplace.json`, `plugin.json`) and refreshed every count to 180; regenerated exports (906 files), OG cards, and the hero GIF/social preview.

## [22.3.0] — Monetization & a Polished Playground — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Sponsors program** — tiers + value props ([SPONSORS.md](SPONSORS.md)), an auto-rendered sponsor wall on the Community page, and the GitHub Sponsors button (`FUNDING.yml`).
- **Embeddable widget** ([`web/embed.js`](web/embed.js)) — drop `<div data-pm-skill="…">` on any site for a branded "Run this skill" card that links back; copy-paste snippet on every skill page.
- **Pro / Teams page** (`pro.html`) — private skills, shared team context, custom packs; Partner tier today + a waitlist.
- **Playground polish:** a **⌘K command palette** (ranked fuzzy search of skills + tools), a **hero landing** with animated stats + the Auto-Agent demo, **favourites + recently-used**, a site-wide **light/dark theme** toggle, **compare-models** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku side by side), and **save-as-image** (branded PNG of any result).
- **Repo social-preview image** for shareable links.

### Changed
- **README glow-up** — a native **Mermaid** lifecycle diagram, an honest **"How it compares"** table, and an animated typing header.
- **Shared navigation** (`web/nav.js`) is now the single source for the tools bar *and* theme, applied consistently across every page (fixes catalog/leaderboard drift + theme).

## [22.2.0] — Skill Studio, Auto-Agent & Editor Extension — 2026-06-20

Lower the bar to *create* skills, raise the ceiling on *using* them, and meet people in their editor.

### Added
- **Skill Studio** (`studio.html`) — describe a skill in the browser and generate a complete, standards-compliant `SKILL.md` (frontmatter, "work from a brief" rule, structured output, quality checks, anti-patterns), then **open a prefilled GitHub pull request in one click**. The frictionless on-ramp that feeds the eval-gated contribution flow.
- **Auto-Agent** (`agent.html`) — give a plain-English goal; the model **plans an ordered chain of skills** from the 175-skill catalog (with reasoning) and **runs them in sequence**, each step's output feeding the next.
- **VS Code / Cursor extension** (`vscode-extension/`) — search all 175 skills from the Command Palette and insert one as context for Copilot/Cursor chat, copy it, or open it in the Playground. Includes dev + publish docs.

### Changed
- **Shared navigation** (`web/nav.js`) — the tools bar is now a single source of truth injected into every static and generated page, eliminating per-page duplication (which had caused catalog/leaderboard to drift).

## [22.1.0] — The Skills Hub, Contribution Flow & a Redesign — 2026-06-20

The library becomes a community **platform** — with a benchmark, a contributor flow, a place to gather, and a much sharper look.

### Added
- **Skills Hub (GitHub-native, no backend):**
  - **Per-skill discussion threads** on every skill page via Giscus (backed by GitHub Discussions).
  - A **Community page** (`community.html`) with a live activity feed, contributor wall, and skill-of-the-week, generated from the GitHub API at deploy time.
  - **Discussion category templates** (Show & Tell, Recipes) + **Share-to-Hub** buttons in the Playground and Grade tool that open a prefilled Show & Tell post.
- **Eval-gated contribution flow:** a PR check validates structure and cheaply scores only the *changed* skills (`run-evals --changed`), posting the result on the PR; plus a submit-a-skill issue form.
- **Grade your work** (`grade.html`): paste a draft, get a rubric score + ranked gaps + a redline against any skill's framework. A "Grade your draft" CTA is on every skill page.
- **Public Benchmark page** (`benchmark.html`) framing the eval as an open standard for AI professional-work quality.
- A prominent **tools navigation bar** across all browser tools.

### Changed
- **Redesigned the web UI** — gradient header, accent-gradient nav and buttons, richer background, card hover states, and focus rings. Less bland, more product.
- **Cost-optimized the eval engine** — cheaper defaults (one model + Sonnet judge, ~$0.30/run), `--dry-run` estimate, skip-unchanged via content hash, `--changed` and `--max-skills`; removed all auto-spending crons. Hardened the API client (honor `Retry-After`, more retries).

## [22.0.0] — Closing the Loop — 2026-06-20

The library stops being a one-shot generator and starts closing loops — improving itself, grading your work, grounding in your data, and composing visually.

### Added
- **Self-improving skills** — `scripts/improve-skill.mjs` + a weekly workflow: eval → judge critique → rewrite the SKILL.md → re-eval, **keeping the rewrite only if the score rises**. Logged to `SKILL-IMPROVEMENTS.md`.
- **Critique mode** (Playground) — paste an existing draft and get a rubric score, ranked gaps, and a redline, graded against the skill's framework. Generate *or* evaluate.
- **Data grounding** — load a real file into your context in the Playground; documented MCP connector pattern so skills act on live sources (Linear, Drive, a database).
- **Workflow Canvas** (`web/canvas.html`) — drag skills into a custom chain and run it, each step feeding the next; shareable recipe links.
- **Red-Team Review skill** + `/red-team` — stress-test a plan against hostile expert personas, with ranked blind spots, a pre-mortem, and prioritised fixes. Library is now **175 skills**.
- **Eval-scored filter** in the Playground so the (now 15) eval badges are easy to find.

### Changed
- **Hardened the eval client** — honor `Retry-After`, retry 429/529/5xx up to 5× with capped backoff+jitter, lower eval concurrency (4 → 2). Leaderboard runs now complete reliably.
- **Fixed three skills the eval flagged** — `go-to-market`, `okr-builder`, `roadmap-narrative` went from ~2.0/5 to **4.75/5** with a "work from a brief" rule. Eval coverage expanded 6 → 15 skills.
- Hyphen/space-insensitive Playground search (so "red team" finds `red-team-review`).

## [21.1.1] — Framework Attribution & a Leaner README — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Framework attribution** — `skill-sources.json` cites the canonical method each skill encodes
  (RICE, Jobs-to-be-Done, Continuous Discovery, Porter's Five Forces, the Pyramid Principle,
  Google SRE, WCAG, *Obviously Awesome*, and more). Shown as a "📚 Based on" line in the
  Playground and on every per-skill page. 50 skills attributed; the rest intentionally left
  unattributed rather than given a fabricated citation. `skill-sources.json` now ships in the package.

### Changed
- **README slimmed ~38%** (1,361 → ~850 lines): the full 174-skill catalog moved to
  [`SKILLS.md`](SKILLS.md), changelog history collapsed to latest + link, article series collapsed,
  positioning one-liner sharpened, and a Claude Cowork install path added.

## [21.1.0] — Skill Memory, Onboarding, Social Cards & ChatOps — 2026-06-19

Make the library personal, easy to start with, and shareable.

### Added
- **Skill Memory (context layer)** — set your company/product/audience/voice once and every
  skill personalizes its output. New `/setup-context` command + `templates/pm-context.example.md`
  for Claude Code; a saved "Your context" box in the Playground that's prepended to every run.
- **Role-based onboarding** — first-visit "what's your role?" prompt (PM / Founder / CSM /
  Marketing / Engineering) surfaces a curated starter pack, with a "show all 174" escape.
- **Branded social cards** — a 1200×630 Open Graph image per skill (`scripts/build-og-images.mjs`),
  wired into every per-skill page so shared links render a polished preview.
- **ChatOps Skill Bot** — comment `/skill <name>` on a GitHub issue/PR and the skill runs and
  replies inline (`.github/workflows/skill-bot.yml`); gated to repo collaborators.

### Changed
- `templates/` now ships in the npm package (so `/setup-context` can read the template).

## [21.0.0] — Workflow Recipes, Eval-Verified Quality & a Smarter Playground — 2026-06-19

The biggest update yet — the 174 skills become a *system*, not just a catalog.

### Added
- **Workflow Recipes** — chain skills into one flow, where each output feeds the next. Five
  cross-profession recipes ship as slash commands and over MCP: `/ship-a-feature`,
  `/close-the-quarter`, `/launch-a-product`, `/rescue-an-account`, `/run-discovery`. Defined in
  `workflows.json`, documented in `WORKFLOWS.md` (generated + validated by `scripts/build-workflows.mjs`).
- **Eval-verified quality** — real eval scores (structure, completeness, usefulness, grounding;
  judged by Opus 4.8) now surface as badges in the Playground and leaderboard. Eval coverage
  expanded from 6 to 15 skills.
- **One-click MCP** — `claude mcp add pm-skills -- npx -y pm-claude-skills-mcp` makes every skill
  and recipe available in any MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf). New
  `list_workflows` / `get_workflow` MCP tools.
- **Playground upgrades** — a "which skill do I need?" recommender, a Compare toggle (run inputs
  with vs. without the skill, side by side), and shareable deep-links that prefill inputs.
- **Sample-output gallery** (`examples.html`) — 18 real example outputs so you can see what each
  skill produces before running anything. Generated via a workflow using the API-key secret.
- **Skill of the week** — a scheduled workflow composes weekly X/LinkedIn posts; an optional
  webhook auto-publishes.

### Changed
- README leads with a problem-solution hook, a workflow lifecycle diagram, a "hero five"
  quick-start, and an animated demo (plus a Compare-mode demo).

## [20.2.0] — Community PRs & New Skill — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **New skill: YouTube Script Writer** (experimental) — retention-optimized video scripts with
  3 title/thumbnail concepts, 3 hook variations, a video/audio cue script table, and SEO
  metadata. Thanks @prajwal-28 (#50). Library is now **174 skills**.
- **Feature-prioritisation helper script** — a dependency-free (stdlib-only) Python helper that
  computes RICE/ICE rankings from JSON/CSV/stdin, so scoring is consistent across sessions.
  Thanks @zeotrix (#48, closes #39).

### Changed
- **Safer installs** — the CLI now resolves the install target and refuses system-critical
  directories (`/`, `/usr`, `/etc`, `/root`, …) so a mistyped `--target` can't clobber the
  system. Thanks @MatrixNeoKozak (#47).
- **README catalog reconciled to the real count** — the headline, badge, table of contents, and
  "All Skills" catalog now say **174** (was a stale 167); added catalog entries for Skill
  Security Auditor (#168), Launch Readiness (#169), and YouTube Script Writer (#170).

### Fixed
- **`skillcheck` frontmatter parser** tolerates leading whitespace and CRLF/LF line endings, so
  skills authored on Windows no longer produce false negatives. Thanks @MatrixNeoKozak (#47).
- **`npm run check` now guards `web/skills.json`** — it rebuilds the file and fails on any drift,
  so a stale playground index can't pass locally and then break CI.

## [20.1.0] — Star Nudges & Eval Hardening — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Star the repo, from anywhere you use it.** Tasteful, non-spammy calls-to-action that turn
  npm/CLI users into stargazers — no `postinstall` hook: a prompt after a successful
  `npx pm-claude-skills add`, in `--help`, in `list`, in the MCP server's startup banner, a
  CTA below the README badges (npm renders it on the package page), and a `funding` field in
  `package.json` so npm shows a Fund/Sponsor link.
- **One-click leaderboard updates in CI** — `.github/workflows/eval-leaderboard.yml`
  ("Update Skill Leaderboard") runs the evals with the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret, commits
  `evals/results.json`, and the Pages deploy re-renders the public leaderboard with real
  numbers — no local key needed. The deploy workflow now also triggers on
  `evals/results.json`.

### Changed
- **Leaderboard workflow opens a PR** instead of pushing to `main` (which the branch
  ruleset blocks). After it runs, merge the auto-created results PR to publish real numbers.
- **Faster, hang-proof evals.** The Anthropic client now has a per-request timeout (120s)
  and limited retries (429/5xx/timeout); the eval harness runs cases concurrently
  (default 4). The leaderboard workflow has a 20-minute job timeout. A 24-call run that
  was sequential now finishes in a few minutes and can't stall a job indefinitely.

## [20.0.0] — Agentic Tooling — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Dogfooded Action** — `.github/workflows/pr-description.yml` uses our own GitHub Action
  (`uses: ./action`) to auto-write this repo's PR descriptions when a PR opens with an
  empty body (skips quietly without the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret and on forks).
- **GitHub Action** ([`action/`](action/)) — run any skill in CI: `uses:
  mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/action@main` to auto-write PR descriptions,
  changelogs, release notes, or code-review checklists. Composite action +
  dependency-free runner.
- **`generate` command** — `npx pm-claude-skills generate --from <url|file>` turns a
  team's documentation into a `SKILL.md` that follows the authoring standard
  (`bin/generate.mjs`, needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
- **Skill evals + Leaderboard** — `evals/run-evals.mjs` scores skill output across models
  with an LLM judge (structure / completeness / usefulness / grounding);
  `scripts/build-leaderboard.mjs` renders a public `web/leaderboard.html` (built in the
  Pages deploy, linked from the README, catalog, and playground).
- Shared, dependency-free Anthropic client (`bin/lib/anthropic.mjs`) used by all three.

## [19.0.0] — Security Auditor, Personas & Catalog — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Skill Security Auditor** — `scripts/skill-audit.mjs` scans installable content
  (`skills/*/SKILL.md` + each skill's `scripts/`) for prompt injection, data
  exfiltration, dynamic code execution, destructive shell, hardcoded secrets, and hidden
  text. HIGH findings fail CI (`skill-audit.yml`); a `security audit` badge in the README.
  Plus a new **`skill-security-auditor`** skill that teaches the same review for any skill.
- **Personas (output-styles)** — 4 Claude Code output styles in [`output-styles/`](output-styles/)
  (Startup CTO, Growth Marketer, Solo Founder, Product Leader). `--agent claude` now also
  installs `~/.claude/output-styles/`.
- **Orchestration guide** — [`ORCHESTRATION.md`](ORCHESTRATION.md): Skill Chain,
  Multi-Agent Handoff, Domain Deep-Dive, and Solo Sprint patterns for combining skills,
  subagents, and commands.
- **Static skill catalog** — `scripts/build-docs.mjs` generates a server-rendered,
  SEO-indexable `web/catalog.html` of all skills (linked from the README and Playground;
  built in the Pages deploy).
- **Public roadmap** — [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) with now/next/later and a "good first
  issues" list to grow contributors.

## [18.0.0] — Windsurf, Aider & an MCP Server — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **MCP server** — `mcp/server.mjs`, a zero-dependency Model Context Protocol server
  (stdio) exposing `list_skills`, `search_skills`, and `get_skill` so MCP clients (Claude
  Desktop, Cline, …) pull skills on demand. Published as a second bin,
  `npx pm-claude-skills-mcp`.
- **Windsurf & Aider targets** — two more export platforms (`exports/windsurf/*.md`
  workspace rules, `exports/aider/*.md` conventions) and install support in `install.sh`,
  the `npx` CLI, and one-line `windsurf-install.sh` / `aider-install.sh`. The library now
  exports to **5 platforms** (ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider).
- **Hero demo placement** — README "See it in action" block linking to the live Playground,
  ready to swap a `playground-demo.gif` in (recording guide in `web/docs-assets/README.md`).
- **Automated npm publishing** — `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` publishes the package
  to npm (with provenance) when a GitHub Release is published. Requires a one-time
  `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret; no local npm needed.

## [17.0.0] — Agents, Commands & the npx CLI — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **`npx pm-claude-skills` CLI** — a cross-platform Node installer (`bin/cli.mjs`, no bash,
  no git, works on Windows) that installs skills into any agent:
  `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent <claude|hermes|codex|openclaw|cursor>` with
  `--link` / `--target` / `--dry-run`. For `claude` it installs skills + subagents +
  commands. `package.json` is now a publishable package (`bin`, `files`, keywords).
- **Subagents & slash commands** — the library now ships content beyond skills:
  4 Claude Code subagents in [`agents/`](agents/) (`pm-partner`, `sprint-master`,
  `cs-guardian`, `launch-captain`) and 6 slash commands in [`commands/`](commands/)
  (`/prd`, `/rice`, `/sprint-plan`, `/health-scorecard`, `/retro`, `/exec-summary`).
  `install.sh --agent claude` now installs skills **+** agents **+** commands.
- **Skill scaffolding generator** — `scripts/new-skill.mjs` (`npm run new-skill`) creates a
  `SKILL.md` that already passes SkillCheck, lowering the barrier to contributing.
- **`package.json`** — `npm run` entry points (`new-skill`, `skillcheck`, `build:exports`,
  `build:web`, `check`) so the repo reads as a real project.
- **README discoverability pass** — keyword-rich H1 (Agent Skills for Claude, ChatGPT,
  Gemini, Cursor, Codex & Hermes), subagent/command count badges, and a Star History chart.
- **SkillCheck validator** — `scripts/skillcheck.mjs` validates every `SKILL.md` against
  the authoring standard (frontmatter, name/folder match, trigger + produces clauses,
  required headings, tier referential integrity). Errors fail CI; `--strict` also fails on
  warnings. New `skillcheck.yml` workflow and a SkillCheck badge in the README.
- **Cursor export platform** — `build-exports.mjs` now also generates
  `exports/cursor/<bundle>/<skill>/<skill>.mdc` rule files (the registry now supports
  per-skill filenames).
- **Per-agent installers** — `scripts/install.sh` (a unified installer for
  claude · hermes · codex · openclaw · cursor, with `--link` / `--target` / `--dry-run`),
  plus curl-able one-liners `scripts/codex-install.sh`, `scripts/openclaw-install.sh`, and
  `scripts/cursor-install.sh` that clone the library and install in one command.

## [16.0.0] — Multi-Platform — 2026-06-17

The library stops being Claude-only and becomes a portable, single-source-of-truth project.

### Added
- **Hermes Agent support (native).** `scripts/sync-hermes-skills.py` installs the
  canonical `skills/` into `~/.hermes/skills/` (copy or `--link` symlink). Hermes reads
  the same open `SKILL.md` standard, so there is no format conversion — it auto-discovers
  skills by their `description`, exactly like Claude Code.
- **Multi-platform export generator.** `scripts/build-exports.mjs` renders every skill
  into platform-ready files under `exports/` from a single source of truth (the
  `SKILL.md` body), so content is never maintained twice. Ships **ChatGPT**
  (`exports/chatgpt/.../SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`) and **Google Gemini**
  (`exports/gemini/.../GEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) exports, plus a `PLATFORMS` registry that
  makes adding Cursor/etc. a few lines. Includes a `--check` mode and a
  `check-generated` CI workflow that fails if exports or `web/skills.json` drift.
- **Programmatic helpers (stdlib Python) for three flagship skills.** Each runs with
  zero dependencies and computes part of the work instead of estimating by hand:
  - `sprint-planning/scripts/capacity_calculator.py` — recommended sprint commitment
    from team size, availability, velocity, and carry-over (caps at 80% of velocity).
  - `rice-prioritisation/scripts/rice_calculator.py` — calculates and ranks RICE
    scores from JSON/CSV and auto-flags quick wins, moonshots, and low-confidence items.
  - `cs-health-scorecard/scripts/health_score.py` — weighted health total out of 100
    with RAG banding and weight validation.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — this file, back-filled from the release history.
- **`SKILL-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md`** — the canonical structure every SKILL.md follows
  (frontmatter, required sections, quality bar, anti-patterns).
- **Skill tiers** — a `TIERS.md` reference and README section marking skills as
  **Production-Ready**, **Stable**, or **Experimental** so new users start with the
  strongest work.
- **Cross-tool compatibility** — README now documents which platforms the skills work
  on (Claude Code and Hermes natively; the SKILL.md bodies port to other agents and chat LLMs).
- **Skill Playground upgrades** — the hosted web app gains a **tier filter** and per-tile
  tier badges, plus a *"Use this skill in another tool"* panel that copies the
  instructions formatted for ChatGPT, Gemini, or raw. Tier data comes from a single
  machine-readable source, `skill-tiers.json`.
- **Related Projects** — README section linking to other community Claude Skills
  libraries and the `awesome-claude-skills` / `awesome-claude-code` lists.

### Changed
- **Multi-platform rebrand.** README title, tagline, intro, and badges now position the
  library for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Hermes — not Claude alone. (The repository
  name, marketplace ID, and install commands are unchanged.)
- `SECURITY.md` supported-versions table updated to the v16 release line.

### Fixed
- **`web/skills.json` is now deterministic.** Removed the wall-clock `generatedAt` field
  (it was unused by the UI and made every rebuild differ), so the new `check-generated`
  CI step can reliably verify the index is in sync with the source skills.

## [15.0.0] — Skill Playground — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Skill Playground** — a zero-backend browser app (`web/`) to run any skill with your own
  Claude API key. Tile gallery with search + bundle filter, click-to-run forms generated from
  each skill's `Required Inputs`, live streaming output with copy / download-as-`.md`, and a
  model picker. `web/build-skills.mjs` generates `skills.json`; a GitHub Actions workflow
  auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

### Fixed
- Mid-stream API errors now surface to the user instead of being silently swallowed.
- `max_tokens` raised to 8192 to avoid truncating long outputs.

## [14.0.0] — Writers & Content Creators + 7 Community Skills

### Added
- New profession **Writers & Content Creators** (`pm-writers`): Instagram Post
  Downloader, AEO Optimizer, Thumbnail Creator, Substack Notes Scraper, Notes Humanizer.
- `pm-cross` (+3): Sycophancy Challenger, Last 30 Days Research, NotebookLM Connector.
- `pm-operations` (+2): Email Triage, Morning Intelligence.
- `pm-engineering` (+2): Context Mode, Claude Superpowers.

Library now spans **167 skills** across **18 professions** + 4 agent templates.

## [13.0.0] — Social Media Profession

### Added
- New bundle `pm-social`: Social Media Audit, Influencer Brief, Community Management
  Playbook, Social Ad Campaign, Viral Content Framework.

## [12.0.0] — 150 Skills Milestone

### Added
- 15 skills across 10 bundles, including Cohort Analysis, Data Pipeline Spec, Renewal
  Playbook, Customer Success Plan, 360-Degree Feedback Template, Team Health Check, Risk
  Register, RACI Matrix, Social Media Strategy, Product Positioning Doc, Customer Journey
