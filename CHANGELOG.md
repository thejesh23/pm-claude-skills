# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project broadly follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):
each new wave of skills bumps the **major** version, extensions and fixes bump
**minor** / **patch**.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Faster, hang-proof evals.** The Anthropic client now has a per-request timeout (120s)
  and limited retries (429/5xx/timeout); the eval harness runs cases concurrently
  (default 4). The leaderboard workflow has a 20-minute job timeout. A 24-call run that
  was sequential now finishes in a few minutes and can't stall a job indefinitely.

### Added
- **One-click leaderboard updates in CI** — `.github/workflows/eval-leaderboard.yml`
  ("Update Skill Leaderboard") runs the evals with the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret, commits
  `evals/results.json`, and the Pages deploy re-renders the public leaderboard with real
  numbers — no local key needed. The deploy workflow now also triggers on
  `evals/results.json`.

## [20.0.0] — Agentic Tooling — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Dogfooded Action** — `.github/workflows/pr-description.yml` uses our own GitHub Action
  (`uses: ./action`) to auto-write this repo's PR descriptions when a PR opens with an
  empty body (skips quietly without the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret and on forks).
- **GitHub Action** ([`action/`](action/)) — run any skill in CI: `uses:
  mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/action@main` to auto-write PR descriptions,
  changelogs, release notes, or code-review checklists. Composite action +
  dependency-free runner.
- **`generate` command** — `npx pm-claude-skills generate --from <url|file>` turns a
  team's documentation into a `SKILL.md` that follows the authoring standard
  (`bin/generate.mjs`, needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
- **Skill evals + Leaderboard** — `evals/run-evals.mjs` scores skill output across models
  with an LLM judge (structure / completeness / usefulness / grounding);
  `scripts/build-leaderboard.mjs` renders a public `web/leaderboard.html` (built in the
  Pages deploy, linked from the README, catalog, and playground).
- Shared, dependency-free Anthropic client (`bin/lib/anthropic.mjs`) used by all three.

## [19.0.0] — Security Auditor, Personas & Catalog — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Skill Security Auditor** — `scripts/skill-audit.mjs` scans installable content
  (`skills/*/SKILL.md` + each skill's `scripts/`) for prompt injection, data
  exfiltration, dynamic code execution, destructive shell, hardcoded secrets, and hidden
  text. HIGH findings fail CI (`skill-audit.yml`); a `security audit` badge in the README.
  Plus a new **`skill-security-auditor`** skill that teaches the same review for any skill.
- **Personas (output-styles)** — 4 Claude Code output styles in [`output-styles/`](output-styles/)
  (Startup CTO, Growth Marketer, Solo Founder, Product Leader). `--agent claude` now also
  installs `~/.claude/output-styles/`.
- **Orchestration guide** — [`ORCHESTRATION.md`](ORCHESTRATION.md): Skill Chain,
  Multi-Agent Handoff, Domain Deep-Dive, and Solo Sprint patterns for combining skills,
  subagents, and commands.
- **Static skill catalog** — `scripts/build-docs.mjs` generates a server-rendered,
  SEO-indexable `web/catalog.html` of all skills (linked from the README and Playground;
  built in the Pages deploy).
- **Public roadmap** — [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) with now/next/later and a "good first
  issues" list to grow contributors.

## [18.0.0] — Windsurf, Aider & an MCP Server — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **MCP server** — `mcp/server.mjs`, a zero-dependency Model Context Protocol server
  (stdio) exposing `list_skills`, `search_skills`, and `get_skill` so MCP clients (Claude
  Desktop, Cline, …) pull skills on demand. Published as a second bin,
  `npx pm-claude-skills-mcp`.
- **Windsurf & Aider targets** — two more export platforms (`exports/windsurf/*.md`
  workspace rules, `exports/aider/*.md` conventions) and install support in `install.sh`,
  the `npx` CLI, and one-line `windsurf-install.sh` / `aider-install.sh`. The library now
  exports to **5 platforms** (ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider).
- **Hero demo placement** — README "See it in action" block linking to the live Playground,
  ready to swap a `playground-demo.gif` in (recording guide in `web/docs-assets/README.md`).
- **Automated npm publishing** — `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` publishes the package
  to npm (with provenance) when a GitHub Release is published. Requires a one-time
  `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret; no local npm needed.

## [17.0.0] — Agents, Commands & the npx CLI — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **`npx pm-claude-skills` CLI** — a cross-platform Node installer (`bin/cli.mjs`, no bash,
  no git, works on Windows) that installs skills into any agent:
  `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent <claude|hermes|codex|openclaw|cursor>` with
  `--link` / `--target` / `--dry-run`. For `claude` it installs skills + subagents +
  commands. `package.json` is now a publishable package (`bin`, `files`, keywords).
- **Subagents & slash commands** — the library now ships content beyond skills:
  4 Claude Code subagents in [`agents/`](agents/) (`pm-partner`, `sprint-master`,
  `cs-guardian`, `launch-captain`) and 6 slash commands in [`commands/`](commands/)
  (`/prd`, `/rice`, `/sprint-plan`, `/health-scorecard`, `/retro`, `/exec-summary`).
  `install.sh --agent claude` now installs skills **+** agents **+** commands.
- **Skill scaffolding generator** — `scripts/new-skill.mjs` (`npm run new-skill`) creates a
  `SKILL.md` that already passes SkillCheck, lowering the barrier to contributing.
- **`package.json`** — `npm run` entry points (`new-skill`, `skillcheck`, `build:exports`,
  `build:web`, `check`) so the repo reads as a real project.
- **README discoverability pass** — keyword-rich H1 (Agent Skills for Claude, ChatGPT,
  Gemini, Cursor, Codex & Hermes), subagent/command count badges, and a Star History chart.
- **SkillCheck validator** — `scripts/skillcheck.mjs` validates every `SKILL.md` against
  the authoring standard (frontmatter, name/folder match, trigger + produces clauses,
  required headings, tier referential integrity). Errors fail CI; `--strict` also fails on
  warnings. New `skillcheck.yml` workflow and a SkillCheck badge in the README.
- **Cursor export platform** — `build-exports.mjs` now also generates
  `exports/cursor/<bundle>/<skill>/<skill>.mdc` rule files (the registry now supports
  per-skill filenames).
- **Per-agent installers** — `scripts/install.sh` (a unified installer for
  claude · hermes · codex · openclaw · cursor, with `--link` / `--target` / `--dry-run`),
  plus curl-able one-liners `scripts/codex-install.sh`, `scripts/openclaw-install.sh`, and
  `scripts/cursor-install.sh` that clone the library and install in one command.

## [16.0.0] — Multi-Platform — 2026-06-17

The library stops being Claude-only and becomes a portable, single-source-of-truth project.

### Added
- **Hermes Agent support (native).** `scripts/sync-hermes-skills.py` installs the
  canonical `skills/` into `~/.hermes/skills/` (copy or `--link` symlink). Hermes reads
  the same open `SKILL.md` standard, so there is no format conversion — it auto-discovers
  skills by their `description`, exactly like Claude Code.
- **Multi-platform export generator.** `scripts/build-exports.mjs` renders every skill
  into platform-ready files under `exports/` from a single source of truth (the
  `SKILL.md` body), so content is never maintained twice. Ships **ChatGPT**
  (`exports/chatgpt/.../SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`) and **Google Gemini**
  (`exports/gemini/.../GEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) exports, plus a `PLATFORMS` registry that
  makes adding Cursor/etc. a few lines. Includes a `--check` mode and a
  `check-generated` CI workflow that fails if exports or `web/skills.json` drift.
- **Programmatic helpers (stdlib Python) for three flagship skills.** Each runs with
  zero dependencies and computes part of the work instead of estimating by hand:
  - `sprint-planning/scripts/capacity_calculator.py` — recommended sprint commitment
    from team size, availability, velocity, and carry-over (caps at 80% of velocity).
  - `rice-prioritisation/scripts/rice_calculator.py` — calculates and ranks RICE
    scores from JSON/CSV and auto-flags quick wins, moonshots, and low-confidence items.
  - `cs-health-scorecard/scripts/health_score.py` — weighted health total out of 100
    with RAG banding and weight validation.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — this file, back-filled from the release history.
- **`SKILL-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md`** — the canonical structure every SKILL.md follows
  (frontmatter, required sections, quality bar, anti-patterns).
- **Skill tiers** — a `TIERS.md` reference and README section marking skills as
  **Production-Ready**, **Stable**, or **Experimental** so new users start with the
  strongest work.
- **Cross-tool compatibility** — README now documents which platforms the skills work
  on (Claude Code and Hermes natively; the SKILL.md bodies port to other agents and chat LLMs).
- **Skill Playground upgrades** — the hosted web app gains a **tier filter** and per-tile
  tier badges, plus a *"Use this skill in another tool"* panel that copies the
  instructions formatted for ChatGPT, Gemini, or raw. Tier data comes from a single
  machine-readable source, `skill-tiers.json`.
- **Related Projects** — README section linking to other community Claude Skills
  libraries and the `awesome-claude-skills` / `awesome-claude-code` lists.

### Changed
- **Multi-platform rebrand.** README title, tagline, intro, and badges now position the
  library for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Hermes — not Claude alone. (The repository
  name, marketplace ID, and install commands are unchanged.)
- `SECURITY.md` supported-versions table updated to the v16 release line.

### Fixed
- **`web/skills.json` is now deterministic.** Removed the wall-clock `generatedAt` field
  (it was unused by the UI and made every rebuild differ), so the new `check-generated`
  CI step can reliably verify the index is in sync with the source skills.

## [15.0.0] — Skill Playground — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Skill Playground** — a zero-backend browser app (`web/`) to run any skill with your own
  Claude API key. Tile gallery with search + bundle filter, click-to-run forms generated from
  each skill's `Required Inputs`, live streaming output with copy / download-as-`.md`, and a
  model picker. `web/build-skills.mjs` generates `skills.json`; a GitHub Actions workflow
  auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

### Fixed
- Mid-stream API errors now surface to the user instead of being silently swallowed.
- `max_tokens` raised to 8192 to avoid truncating long outputs.

## [14.0.0] — Writers & Content Creators + 7 Community Skills
