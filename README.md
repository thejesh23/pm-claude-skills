## ⚡ Use it in 30 seconds — pick one

| You want to… | Do this |
|---|---|
| **Just try it** (no install) | Open the **[Playground](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/)** → pick a skill → run it in your browser. |
| **Use it in Claude Code / Cursor / Codex** | `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent claude` &nbsp;*(or `cursor`, `codex`, `windsurf`…)* |
| **Have it in every AI session** | `claude mcp add pm-skills -- npx -y pm-claude-skills-mcp` |

*Not sure? Start with the Playground.* This is a **CLI, not a library** — you don't need `npm install`; `npx pm-claude-skills …` always runs the latest. Browse everything first with `npx pm-claude-skills list`.

> **PM stands for Professional, not just Product Management.**
> 319 professional skills + 4 agent templates across 46 bundles covering 23 professions. Built for Claude Code — and now portable to ChatGPT, Gemini, and Hermes Agent. Built by a PM, used by everyone.

A community-built library of professional skills for every field — product management, engineering, customer success, marketing, social media, writers, design, legal, finance, HR, sales, operations, research, and more. Each skill is a structured `SKILL.md` file that teaches an AI assistant how to produce professional-grade outputs for your workflows. Skills run natively in **Claude Code** and **Hermes Agent** (same open `SKILL.md` standard), and ship as ready-to-paste exports for **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** — see [Works With](#-works-with--cross-tool-compatibility).

**🆕 Latest — v30.2.0 (中文 interface — a bilingual playground):** the whole playground UI now switches between **English and Simplified Chinese** — every page carries a **🌐 中文 / 🌐 English** toggle in the nav (nav, hero, Job Search, Guided Journeys, Catalog, and more are hand-translated, not machine output). Your choice is remembered across visits. This is on top of the **🌐 Translate** button that localizes any *generated result* into 11 languages. *Earlier (v30.1):* a **🌐 Localization bundle** — `professional-translator`, `transcreation`, `localization-brief`, `subtitle-caption`, `glossary-builder`, `i18n-readiness-review`. **319 skills across 46 bundles.** → **[Full release history & notes](https://github.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/releases)**.

## 👋 New here? Start in 30 seconds

**The problem:** Ask any AI for a PRD, an exec update, or a launch plan and you get *generic* — plausible-sounding filler you still have to rewrite from scratch. The model doesn't know what "good" actually looks like for professional work.

**What this fixes:** Each skill is a battle-tested `SKILL.md` that teaches the AI the real structure, rigour, and judgement a senior professional uses — so the first draft is one you can *ship*, not one you have to redo.

**Try these 5 first** — no install needed, run them right in the [live Playground](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/):

| Skill | Give it… | Get back… |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 📊 [Executive Update](skills/executive-update) | messy progress notes | a tight 250-word briefing for your CEO or board |
| 📋 [PRD Template](skills/prd-template) | a vague feature idea | a structured PRD with scope, success metrics & risks |
| 🎯 [RICE Prioritisation](skills/rice-prioritisation) | a pile of backlog ideas | a ranked, defensible priority list |
| 🔭 [Competitor Teardown](skills/competitor-teardown) | "what are rivals up to?" | a positioning map, feature gaps & strategy |
| 📝 [Meeting Notes](skills/meeting-notes) | a raw transcript | decisions, owners & next steps |

## 🧠 The Professional Brain — local-first memory for any AI agent

Generic AI forgets everything between sessions, so you re-paste context forever and last quarter's *why* evaporates. The **Professional Brain** is the fix — and it's the most novel piece here, worth a look on its own:

- **Plain markdown, no vector DB** — a `brain/` folder (knowledge · decisions · hypotheses · stakeholders) your AI **reads before answering and writes to after**. Grep-able, auditable, Obsidian-compatible — memory you can read and correct by hand, not a black box.
- **Provenance over confidence theatre** — every fact is tagged `[data] [interview] [external] [verbal] [hunch]`, so a hunch never poses as a measured result.
- **It acts, safely** — the [`action-runner`](skills/action-runner/) turns a skill's recommendations into real tickets/messages: dry-run, risk-rated, approval-gated, then recorded back. *Nothing acts silently.*

**→ [Read the architecture](BRAIN.md)** · **[5-min Quickstart](BRAIN_QUICKSTART.md)** · **[try it in the browser](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/brain.html)**

## 🧩 Workflow Recipes — chain skills into one flow

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

Individual skills are great. **Chaining** them is the superpower. A *recipe* runs several skills in sequence and **passes each output forward as context** — so a fuzzy idea comes out the other end as a finished, joined-up set of artifacts. No other skills library chains across professions like this.

```
/ship-a-feature  "a referral program for B2B users"

  ambiguity-resolver → prd-template → rice-prioritisation → roadmap-narrative → go-to-market
   frame the problem    spec it        prioritise it        place on roadmap     launch plan
        └──────────────── each stage's output feeds the next ────────────────┘
```

| Recipe | What it does | Lifecycle |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| `/ship-a-feature` | idea → PRD → priority → roadmap → launch plan | Discover → Ship |
| `/close-the-quarter` | metrics → churn → exec update → board deck | Measure → Communicate |
| `/launch-a-product` | competitors → positioning → GTM → checklist → press release | Decide → Ship |
| `/rescue-an-account` | health score → churn cause → escalation → renewal plan | Measure → Communicate |
| `/run-discovery` | frame → interview guide → synthesis → prioritise | Discover → Decide |

→ Full detail and how to add your own in [**WORKFLOWS.md**](WORKFLOWS.md). Recipes run as slash commands in Claude Code, or over MCP via the `get_workflow` tool.

**Got a coding question?** Just [**❓ Ask**](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/ask.html) — an error, a regex, a git mess, a dependency conflict, *"what does this code do?"* — and the right developer skill answers instantly (like StackOverflow, but the answer's already written), with a one-click path to the community [Q&A](https://github.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/discussions) for a human follow-up.

**Or build your own visually.** The [**Workflow Canvas**](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/canvas.html) lets you drag any skills into a custom chain and run it in the browser — each step's output feeds the next. Like n8n, but for professional thinking. Don't know which skills to use? The [**✨ Auto-Agent**](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/agent.html) takes a plain-English goal, **plans which skills to chain**, and runs them for you — each step feeding the next:

[![Auto-Agent — a goal becomes a planned chain of skills that runs end to end](web/docs-assets/agent-demo.gif)](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/agent.html)

## 🧠 Skill Memory — set your context once, every skill uses it

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

Generic output is the #1 complaint with AI. **Skill Memory** fixes it: tell the skills who you are *once*, and every skill and recipe produces output already tuned to your product, audience, and voice — no re-typing.

- **In Claude Code:** run [`/setup-context`](commands/setup-context.md) (or copy [`templates/pm-context.example.md`](templates/pm-context.example.md) → `pm-context.md`). Skills read it as standing context.
- **In the [Playground](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/):** fill the **🧠 Your context** box — it's saved in your browser and prepended to every run.

```
Without context:  "write an exec update" → generic, you rewrite it
With context:      "write an exec update" → your voice, your metrics,
                    your audience — shippable on the first try
```

## 🤖 Run a skill from a GitHub comment (ChatOps)

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

This repo ships a [**Skill Bot**](.github/workflows/skill-bot.yml): comment on any issue or PR and a skill runs and replies inline.

```
/skill executive-update
Audience: CEO. Period: Q2. Shipped onboarding redesign; activation up; hiring behind plan.
```

The bot runs the skill and posts the result as a reply. `/skill list` shows usage. It's gated to repo collaborators (so random commenters can't trigger paid API calls) and needs an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret. Copy the workflow into your own repo to give your whole team skill-powered ChatOps.

## ✅ Eval-verified quality — not just quantity

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

**Grounded in canonical frameworks.** These aren't invented prompts — each skill encodes a proven method and cites it: RICE (Intercom), Jobs-to-be-Done (Christensen), Continuous Discovery (Teresa Torres), Porter's Five Forces, the Pyramid Principle (Minto), Google SRE, WCAG, *Obviously Awesome* (April Dunford), and more. The source shows as a **"📚 Based on"** line on every [skill page](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/skill/rice-prioritisation.html) and in the Playground.

**And measured, not just claimed.** An [eval harness](evals/) runs each skill against a held-out test case, then an LLM judge (Opus 4.8) rates the output on four dimensions — **structure, completeness, usefulness, grounding** — averaged across two models. **208 skills are eval-scored** today (and climbing); the rest are reviewed against the [authoring standard](SKILL-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md). A **[regression gate](.github/workflows/skill-pr-check.yml)** then blocks any PR that drops a skill's score, so quality can't quietly rot as models change.

**The qualitative half — real time saved.** Scores measure quality; **[case studies](CASE_STUDIES.md)** measure outcomes. See the kind of before → after a skill delivers (PRD: ~2 days → ~25 min), and **[add your own 2-minute ROI story](../../issues/new?template=roi-story.yml)** — we'll feature it.

**The loop actually catches bad skills.** A recent run flagged three skills scoring ~2/5 because they asked for missing inputs instead of delivering. We added a "work from a brief" rule, re-ran, and they jumped to **4.75/5**:

| Skill | Before | After |
|-------|:------:|:-----:|
| `go-to-market` | 🔴 2.0 | 🟢 **4.75** |
| `okr-builder` | 🔴 2.25 | 🟢 **4.75** |
| `roadmap-narrative` | 🟡 2.75 | 🟢 **4.75** |

That's not luck — it's a [self-improving pipeline](scripts/improve-skill.mjs) (`/improve`) that critiques and rewrites a skill, keeping the change only if the score goes up. See the [🏆 leaderboard](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/leaderboard.html) for live scores; run it yourself with `node evals/run-evals.mjs`.

**See the difference for yourself.** The Playground's *Compare* toggle runs the same inputs with and without the skill, side by side — structured, shippable output on the left; generic mush on the right:

[![Compare mode — the same prompt with and without the skill, side by side](web/docs-assets/compare-demo.gif)](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/)

**Already have a draft?** Flip on **📝 Critique mode** in the Playground — or use the standalone [**Grade your work**](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/grade.html) tool — to paste an existing PRD/roadmap/update and get a rubric score, ranked gaps, and a redline graded against the skill's framework. Before you ship, run [**`/red-team`**](skills/red-team-review/SKILL.md) to stress-test the plan against a room of hostile expert personas.

This whole thing is an open, reproducible **[benchmark for AI professional work](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/benchmark.html)** — and it's *eval-gated*: every contributed skill is auto-checked for structure and scored on the rubric. The easiest way to add one is **[Skill Studio](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/studio.html)** — describe a skill in your browser, generate a compliant `SKILL.md`, and open a pull request in one click ([or use the form →](https://github.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/issues/new?template=submit-skill.yml)).

## ⚖️ How it compares

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

Most skill repos are a folder of prompts. This one is a **system** — measured, composable, and usable in the browser:

| | **PM Skills** | Typical skill repo |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Skills | **319**, across 23 professions | a handful → dozens, usually one domain |
| Quality | **eval-scored** on a rubric + a public [benchmark](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/benchmark.html) | trust the README |
| Improves itself | ✅ eval → critique → rewrite (kept only if it scores higher) | ✗ |
| Grounded in frameworks | ✅ each cites its source (RICE, JTBD, Pyramid Principle…) | rarely |
| Run without installing | ✅ [browser playground](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/) + your key | ✗ copy-paste |
| Compose / orchestrate | ✅ [recipes](WORKFLOWS.md), a [visual canvas](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/canvas.html), an [auto-agent](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/agent.html) | ✗ |
| Works beyond Claude | ✅ MCP · ChatGPT/Gemini exports · VS Code extension | usually one tool |
| Community | ✅ per-skill discussions + a [hub](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/community.html) | issues only |

> **Not sure where to start?** Pick by what you want:
> - **Just try it (0 install):** open the **[live Playground](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/)** and run any skill.
> - **Use it in Claude Code:** `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent claude` (or the `/plugin` route below).
> - **Have it in every session:** add the MCP server (one line, below).
>
> ⚠️ **You don't need `npm install pm-claude-skills`** — it's a CLI, not a library, so there's nothing to import. Use `npx pm-claude-skills …` (it always runs the latest). `npm install` just downloads it and does nothing on its own.

**With the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI** (the open agent-skills installer that works across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode & 60+ agents) — pick from all 319 interactively:

```bash
npx skills add mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills            # browse & pick (auto-detects your agent)
npx skills add mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills --list     # just preview the catalog
npx skills add mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills --skill prd-template   # grab one
npx skills add mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills --skill '*'            # install all 319
```

**Or our own installer** — via the [`pm-claude-skills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm-claude-skills) npm package (Windows/macOS/Linux, needs Node), which also installs subagents, slash commands & cross-tool exports:

```bash
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent claude     # or: codex · cursor · hermes · openclaw
```

**Or one-line MCP** — make all 319 skills + 5 workflow recipes available in *every* session of any MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf), no per-file install:

```bash
claude mcp add pm-skills -- npx -y pm-claude-skills-mcp
```

Your assistant can then *"search the skills for churn"* or *"run the ship-a-feature workflow"* on demand. Details: [mcp/README.md](mcp/README.md).

**In [Claude Cowork](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)** — open the plugin browser → **Add from GitHub** → enter `mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills`, then add the bundles you want. No CLI needed.

**In Claude Code** — it's in the **official Anthropic plugin directory**, so you can browse to it in the `/plugin` marketplace, or add it directly:

/plugin marketplace add mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills

Or install by profession:

claude plugin install pm-essentials@pm-claude-skills     # Core PM + Word tracked changes

claude plugin install pm-delivery@pm-claude-skills       # Delivery + PowerPoint auditor

claude plugin install pm-engineering@pm-claude-skills    # Engineering (35 skills) 🆕

## 🔌 Works With — Cross-Tool Compatibility

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

These skills were built for Claude Code, but they aren't locked to it. Each `SKILL.md` is
two portable parts: a small **frontmatter** block (`name` + `description`) and a
**markdown body** that is just a well-structured set of instructions and output templates.
The body is plain English — so it works anywhere a capable model reads instructions.

There are two kinds of support. **Native `SKILL.md` agents** read the file as-is and
auto-discover skills from the `description` frontmatter. **Other tools** take the markdown
body as a system prompt — for those we ship ready-made [exports](#ready-to-use-exports).

**In your editor (VS Code / Cursor):** the [**`vscode-extension/`**](vscode-extension/) brings all 319 skills into the Command Palette — search and *insert a skill as context* for Copilot/Cursor chat, copy it, or open it in the Playground.

| Platform | How it works | Auto-trigger? |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (CLI / desktop / web / IDE) | Native. Install via the plugin marketplace; Claude loads a skill automatically when your request matches its description. | ✅ Yes |
| **Hermes Agent** (Nous Research) | Native — same open `SKILL.md` standard. Run `python3 scripts/sync-hermes-skills.py` to install into `~/.hermes/skills/`; Hermes auto-discovers them. | ✅ Yes |
| **OpenAI Codex · OpenClaw** | Native `SKILL.md`. One-line install (see [below](#one-line-install-for-coding-agents)) or `./scripts/install.sh --agent codex`. | ✅ Yes |
| **Cursor · Windsurf · Aider** | Generated rules (`.cursor/rules/`, `.windsurf/rules/`, `aider --read`). `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent cursor` (or windsurf / aider). | ⚙️ By description |
| **Cline · Continue · Zed · Roo** | Generated rule files under [`exports/`](exports/) (`.clinerules/`, Continue rules, Zed `.rules`, `.roo/rules/`). | ⚙️ By description |
| **MCP clients** (Claude Desktop, Cline, …) | Run the [MCP server](mcp/) — searches & pulls skills on demand via `npx -y pm-claude-skills-mcp`. Now also serves skills as MCP **prompts + resources**. | ✅ On demand |
| **ChatGPT · Claude.ai · Cursor (remote MCP)** | Deploy the [remote connector](mcp-remote/) and add **one URL** — no install. | ✅ On demand |
| **Python agents** (LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex) | [`pip install pm-skills`](python/) → `search_skills` / `get_skill` / ready-made tool adapters. | ✅ On demand |
| **Run on your own key** (Claude / OpenAI / Gemini / Ollama) | The [Playground](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/) runs any skill live — pick a provider, paste a key (or point at local Ollama). | ▶ In browser |
| **ChatGPT & Gemini (copy-paste)** | Copy a ready-made [export](#ready-to-use-exports) into a Custom GPT or Gem's instructions. | ❌ Paste per use |
| **Claude.ai & Claude API** | Upload a skill, or paste the body in as a system prompt / project instruction. | ⚙️ Manual |
| **Any agent / answer engine** | [`llms.txt`](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/llms.txt) makes the whole library discoverable & citable. | ✅ On demand |

**What's verified vs. what varies:** the skill **bodies** — the frameworks, rubrics, and
output templates that do the actual work — are model-agnostic and have been used across
Claude and other chat LLMs. Native `SKILL.md` agents (Claude Code, Hermes) also get the
convenience layer: automatic skill discovery from the `description`. On chat LLMs you paste
the body in manually and lose only the auto-triggering, not the substance.

### Ready-to-use exports

You don't have to strip frontmatter by hand. Every skill is exported to platform-ready
files under [`exports/`](exports/), generated from the same source so nothing is
maintained twice:

- **ChatGPT** — copy any [`exports/chatgpt/<bundle>/<skill>/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`](exports/chatgpt/) straight into a Custom GPT's instructions.
- **Google Gemini** — copy any [`exports/gemini/<bundle>/<skill>/GEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](exports/gemini/) into a Gem's instructions.
- **Cursor** (`.mdc`) · **Windsurf** (`.md`) · **Aider** (`.md`) — generated rule/conventions files in [`exports/cursor/`](exports/cursor/), [`exports/windsurf/`](exports/windsurf/), [`exports/aider/`](exports/aider/) (or use the installers below).

### One-command install for coding agents

**Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) — recommended.** One Node command installs every skill where your agent discovers them. No git, no bash:

```bash
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent claude     # skills + subagents + commands → ~/.claude/
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent codex      # OpenAI Codex (or: hermes · openclaw)
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent cursor     # .mdc rules → ./.cursor/rules
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent windsurf   # .md rules → ./.windsurf/rules
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent aider      # conventions → load with: aider --read
npx pm-claude-skills list                   # all supported agents + default paths
```

Add `--link` (symlink), `--target <path>`, or `--dry-run` to any `add`.

**Shell one-liners** (macOS / Linux / Git Bash / WSL — *not* PowerShell):

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/main/scripts/codex-install.sh)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/main/scripts/openclaw-install.sh)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/main/scripts/cursor-install.sh)
```

> **Windows / PowerShell:** use the `npx` command above (the `bash <(curl …)` form is a Unix idiom and won't run in PowerShell).

Already cloned? `./scripts/install.sh --agent <name>` (or `python3 scripts/sync-hermes-skills.py` for Hermes) does the same from your checkout.

The skill body in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is the single source of truth. Regenerate the
chat-LLM / Cursor exports (or add a new platform — it's a few lines in the `PLATFORMS` registry) with:

```bash
node scripts/build-exports.mjs            # regenerate all platform exports
node scripts/build-exports.mjs --check    # CI: fail if exports are stale
```

> Prefer a hand-curated ChatGPT collection? There's also a [companion Custom GPT library](#-companion-repository--chatgpt-custom-gpts) built from the same frameworks.

## 🤖 Subagents & Slash Commands

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

It's not just skills. The library also ships **Claude Code subagents** and **slash commands** built on top of the strongest skills, so common workflows are one delegation or one command away.

**Subagents** ([`agents/`](agents/)) — focused personas Claude delegates to automatically by description:

| Agent | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [`pm-partner`](agents/pm-partner.md) | PRDs, prioritisation, stakeholder updates, exec summaries |
| [`sprint-master`](agents/sprint-master.md) | Sprint planning, retros, velocity, user stories |
| [`cs-guardian`](agents/cs-guardian.md) | Account health, churn, renewals, escalations, QBRs |
| [`launch-captain`](agents/launch-captain.md) | Positioning, GTM, launch checklists, competitor teardowns |

**Slash commands** ([`commands/`](commands/)) — run a skill on whatever you pass:

`/prd` · `/rice` · `/sprint-plan` · `/health-scorecard` · `/retro` · `/exec-summary`

**Personas** ([`output-styles/`](output-styles/)) — Claude Code output styles that change the assistant's whole voice and default skill loadout. Switch with `/output-style`:

`Startup CTO` · `Growth Marketer` · `Solo Founder` · `Product Leader`

Install everything for Claude Code in one go (skills **+** subagents **+** commands **+** personas):

```bash
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent claude   # ~/.claude/{skills,agents,commands,output-styles}
```

Commands whose skill ships a Python helper (RICE, sprint capacity, customer health) run it to **compute** results, not estimate them. To string these together, see the [orchestration patterns](ORCHESTRATION.md) (skill chains & multi-agent handoffs).

## 🧩 MCP Server — Skills on Demand

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

For MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cline, …), there's a zero-dependency [**MCP server**](mcp/) so your assistant **searches and pulls skills on demand** instead of installing 172 files. It exposes three tools — `list_skills`, `search_skills`, `get_skill` — over stdio (no network, nothing leaves your machine).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pm-claude-skills": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "pm-claude-skills-mcp"] }
  }
}
```

Then ask: *"search the skills for customer churn, then apply the best one to my account."* Full setup in [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/).

**🔌 Skills that *act* on your data.** Run `pm-skills` alongside a data server (filesystem, GitHub, Postgres, Drive…) and a skill works on your *real* sources: *"draft the PRD **from** GitHub issue #123,"* *"run `churn-analysis` on `exports/q2.csv`,"* *"open an issue per `product-launch-checklist` item."* Copy-paste configs + worked recipes in [**`connectors/`**](connectors/).

> `pm-skills` needs **no auth**. To connect GitHub, Slack, Notion, etc., you add *that* provider's MCP server with its own token/OAuth **once** in your client — then every skill can use it. (filesystem = a folder you grant; GitHub = a PAT; Slack/Notion = OAuth.)

## ⚙️ AI-Powered Tooling

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

Three ways to put the library to work beyond installing files:

**🤖 Run a skill in your CI — [GitHub Action](action/).** Auto-write PR descriptions, changelogs, release notes, or run a code-review checklist on every PR:

```yaml
- uses: mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/action@main
  with:
    skill: pr-description-writer
    input: ${{ steps.diff.outputs.text }}
    api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

**🏗️ Turn your docs into a skill — `generate`.** Point it at a URL or file and it writes a `SKILL.md` that follows the authoring standard:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-… npx pm-claude-skills generate --from ./team-process.md
```

**🏆 Skill Leaderboard — [evals](evals/).** An LLM-as-judge harness scores each skill across Claude models on structure, completeness, usefulness, and grounding. **[View the leaderboard →](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/leaderboard.html)**

> **Score the *whole* library, cheaply.** `npm run eval:gen-cases` writes a representative input for **all 319 skills** (curated cases kept verbatim; the rest auto-generated), then `npm run eval:all` runs the full pass on Haiku for **~$2** total. The weakest scorers can then be auto-rewritten with **`npm run improve -- <skill>`** (`/improve`), which keeps a change only if the score goes up.

## 🤖 Building Blocks for Agent Templates

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

On May 5, 2026, Anthropic [released their first agent templates](https://www.anthropic.com/news/finance-agents) — pre-packaged Claude agents that combine **skills, connectors, and subagents** into ready-to-run workflows for financial services.

This library is the largest open-source collection of professional skills available — covering 20 professions beyond financial services. **The 319 skills here are the building blocks for agent templates outside of finance.**

### What is an agent template?

An agent template packages three things into one runnable workflow:

| Component | What it is | Example from this library |
|---|---|---|
| **Skills** | Markdown files that teach Claude how to produce structured professional outputs | `sprint-planning`, `contract-review`, `investor-update` |
| **Connectors** | Governed access to your team's data sources | Linear, Jira, Slack, Google Drive, Notion |
| **Subagents** | Focused Claude models for sub-tasks within the larger workflow | Capacity analyst, risk scorer, comparables selector |

A skill alone gives Claude a structured output format. An agent template gives Claude a complete workflow — pulling data, running specialised analysis, producing the output, and routing it where it needs to go.

### How to use this library to build your own agent template

Pick a recurring workflow on your team. Identify which existing skills cover the structured outputs that workflow needs. Add the connectors that let Claude reach the data. Add subagents for the analytical sub-tasks. That's the template.

Examples of agent templates this library supports:

| Template | Skills used | Connectors needed | Subagents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PM Sprint Agent** | sprint-planning, sprint-brief, retro, project-status-report | Linear or Jira, Slack | Capacity analyst, risk scorer |

### Available agent templates

The pm-claude-skills library now includes four working agent templates, each built from existing skills in this library combined with subagents and connectors. All four follow the architecture Anthropic introduced for [financial services agent templates](https://www.anthropic.com/news/finance-agents) on May 5, 2026.

| Template | What it does | Skills used | Connectors | Time saved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[PM Sprint Agent](./templates/pm-sprint-agent/)** | End-to-end sprint planning — pulls backlog, calculates capacity, drafts plan, scores risks | sprint-planning, sprint-brief | Linear, Jira | 90 min → 90 sec |
| **[PM Discovery Agent](./templates/pm-discovery-agent/)** | Customer discovery synthesis — reads interview notes, finds themes, scores assumption confidence | user-interview-synthesis, job-story-mapper | Notion, Google Drive | 1 day → 5 min |
| **[PM Stakeholder Comms Agent](./templates/pm-stakeholder-comms-agent/)** | Audience-tailored stakeholder updates — exec, investor, cross-functional, or board | executive-update, investor-update, stakeholder-update, board-deck-narrative | Linear, Jira, Google Drive | 90 min → 1 min |
| **[PM Launch Agent](./templates/pm-launch-agent/)** | End-to-end launch coordination — content for every channel, calendar, metrics, checklist | go-to-market, content-calendar, media-pitch, email-campaign, launch-checklist | Notion (optional) | 4-6 hours → 3 min |

Each template includes:
- Working orchestration script
- Two or more focused subagents
- Connector configurations with documented setup
- Working examples (input + output)
- Smoke test for verifying installations

### How to install a template

All templates are part of the main library — installing the marketplace gives you all four.

/plugin marketplace add mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills

Then navigate to the template you want and follow its README:

cd templates/pm-sprint-agent      # or pm-discovery-agent, etc.
cat README.md                       # full setup instructions

### Building your own template

If you want to build a template for a workflow not covered above — Legal Contract Review, Sales Pursuit, Finance Board Pack, HR Onboarding, Marketing Campaign — see the [template contribution guide](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The pattern is consistent: pick a multi-step workflow, identify which existing skills cover the structured outputs, add connectors for data access, and define subagents for specialised analysis. The four templates above are reference implementations.

It combines four skills, two connectors, and two subagents into a single workflow that handles end-to-end sprint planning.

Documentation, working orchestration script, and example outputs are included in the template folder.

More templates will follow. If you want to contribute one, see the [template contribution guide](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 🏷️ Skill Tiers — Start With the Strongest

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

A 319-skill library doesn't have 319 equally-mature skills, and pretending otherwise
wastes your time. Skills are tiered honestly so you can start with the best work:

- 🟢 **Production-Ready (50)** — battle-tested, stable output, used in real work. Includes the three skills with computed Python helpers (sprint planning, RICE, customer health). **Start here.**
- 🔵 **Stable** — solid, reliable, well-structured; the default for most of the library.
- 🟡 **Experimental** — newer or dependent on an external tool/API/scrape (Gemini, Gmail, browser automation, social scraping). Useful, but more setup and more moving parts.

**👉 Full breakdown: [TIERS.md](TIERS.md)** — every Production-Ready and Experimental skill listed by name.

If you're new, install `pm-essentials` and try a couple of Production-Ready skills before going wide.

## 🌐 Community Skills — get listed, earn the badge

Built your own skills? **[List them in the Community Skills directory](COMMUNITY-SKILLS.md)** —
a place to showcase skill repos and packs that follow the `SKILL.md` standard. It's a **one-row
pull request**, and once it's merged you earn a badge to show off in your own repo:

[![Featured in PM Skills Community](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/assets/community-badge.svg)](COMMUNITY-SKILLS.md)

```markdown
[![Featured in PM Skills Community](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/assets/community-badge.svg)](https://github.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/blob/main/COMMUNITY-SKILLS.md)
```

Community listings live in their authors' own repos and are **community-maintained — not
eval-scored or security-audited** (that's the [curated library](#️-all-319-skills) above). Want
your skill *in* the curated library instead? See **Contributing** below.

## 🤝 Contributing — Add Your Skill

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

This is an open-source community library. If you've built a skill that saves you time, share it here.

**Two ways to share:** contribute a skill into the **curated library** (eval-scored, in the playground/MCP/exports) via the quality-gated flow below — or, if you'd rather keep it in your own repo, **list it in [Community Skills](COMMUNITY-SKILLS.md)** with a one-row PR and earn a **"Featured in PM Skills Community" badge** for your repo (community-maintained, not eval-scored).

**New here?** See the [Roadmap & good first issues](ROADMAP.md#-good-first-issues) for starter tasks. **Found a bug?** [Open a bug report →](../../issues/new?template=bug-report.md).

**How to contribute:**

1. Fork this repo
2. Scaffold a skill that already passes validation: `npm run new-skill -- --name your-skill-name`
   (or copy the template below into `skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md`)
3. Fill in the sections, then check it: `npm run skillcheck`
4. Raise a pull request with a short description of what the skill does and why you built it

> Every PR is gated by **SkillCheck** (structure — `node scripts/skillcheck.mjs`) and the **Skill Security Auditor** (safety — `node scripts/skill-audit.mjs`, which flags prompt-injection / exfiltration / unsafe code). Both must pass.

**SKILL.md template:**
---
name: your-skill-name
description: "One sentence. Use when [trigger condition]. Produces [output description]."
---

# Skill Title

[Instructions for Claude to follow when this skill is invoked]

**What makes a good skill:**
- Solves a recurring professional workflow (not a one-off task)
- Has a clear trigger description so Claude knows when to activate it
- Produces consistent, structured output
- Works without needing extensive setup or context

**Before you submit:** read the **[Skill Authoring Standard](SKILL-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md)** — it documents the exact section structure, frontmatter rules, and quality bar every skill in this library follows (including optional stdlib-only helper scripts).

**Skills wishlist** (most requested — up for grabs):

| Skill | Profession | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `grant-report` | Non-profit | Funder progress reports against grant objectives |
| `architectural-spec` | Architecture | Project specifications and technical drawing briefs |
| `clinical-guideline-summary` | Healthcare | Plain English summaries of clinical guidelines |
| `pitch-deck-feedback` | Startup | Investor-perspective critique of a pitch deck |
| `board-minutes` | Governance | Formal board meeting minutes from discussion notes |

Have a skill idea? Add it to [SKILL_REQUEST.md](SKILL_REQUEST.md), [open an issue](../../issues), or raise it in [Discussions](../../discussions). Most-voted requests get built first.

**Contributors** get credited in this README and in the article series. 🙌

## 🛠️ Custom Skills for Your Team

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

The 155 skills in this library are built for general professional workflows. But the most powerful version of Claude Skills is one built specifically for *your* team — your templates, your terminology, your processes, your quality standards.

**What custom skills look like in practice:**

- A law firm's contract review skill trained on their specific clause library and risk tolerance
- A SaaS company's sprint brief skill that knows their engineering conventions and definition of done
- A finance team's board pack skill that follows their exact narrative structure and slide format
- An HR team's job description skill that reflects their values language and includes their specific benefits

The difference between a generic skill and one built for your context is significant. Generic skills eliminate the blank page. Custom skills eliminate the rework.

**If you want skills built for your team's specific workflows — [get in touch](mailto:mohit15856@gmail.com).**

Include a brief description of your team, the workflows you want to automate, and the tools you use. I'll come back to you within 48 hours.

## 📖 How Skills Work

<details>
<summary>Read more ↓</summary>

Skills are markdown files that Claude reads dynamically. When you describe a task, Claude scans available skill descriptions (~100 tokens) and loads the full skill only when relevant. This means:

- Skills are efficient — they only use tokens when triggered
- Multiple skills can coexist without slowing Claude down
- Personal skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) work across all your projects
- Plugin skills install via the Claude Code marketplace with one command
