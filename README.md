**A library of 630 skills — each one a plain `SKILL.md` file that teaches your AI assistant to do one professional task properly.** Decode a lease before you sign it. Write a PRD your team can execute. Simulate the promotion committee before the real one meets. Check the weather with zero API keys. Generic AI gives you filler; these give you the structure a senior professional actually uses.

Works natively in **Claude Code** and **Hermes Agent**, with ready-to-paste exports for **ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, Codex** and 8 more tools. *(PM stands for Professional, not just Product Management.)*

## ⚡ Quick start

| You want to… | Do this |
|---|---|
| **Browse the skills** | **[SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md)** — the full catalog · or the [searchable web catalog](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/catalog.html) |
| **Install in Claude Code** | `/plugin` → search **pm-skills** *(it's in the official Anthropic directory)* — or `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent claude` |
| **Install in Cursor / Codex / Windsurf / Cline…** | `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent cursor` *(or `codex`, `windsurf`, `aider`, `cline`, `zed`…)* |
| **Use one skill in ChatGPT / Gemini** | Copy it from [`exports/chatgpt/`](exports/chatgpt/) or [`exports/gemini/`](exports/gemini/) and paste as instructions |
| **Skills over MCP, in any session** | `claude mcp add pm-skills -- npx -y pm-claude-skills-mcp` |

No `npm install` needed — `npx pm-claude-skills …` always runs the latest. `npx pm-claude-skills list` shows everything in your terminal. Full per-tool instructions: **[docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)**.

## 📚 The skills

Every skill follows the same discipline: what it produces, the inputs it needs, a real framework (severity scales, decision rules — not vibes), a concrete output template, quality checks, and anti-patterns. All 630 pass the [SkillSpec](SKILLSPEC.md) L3 gate and a security audit in CI.

### Meta

Before installing *anyone's* skills (including these): [skill-vetting](skills/skill-vetting/SKILL.md) — a security read for SKILL.md files. The library's own standard lives in [SKILLSPEC.md](SKILLSPEC.md); every skill's level is enforced in CI.

## 🔍 What a skill looks like

```markdown
---
name: lease-decoder
description: "Decode a residential lease into plain English and rank the
  clauses that can hurt you. Use when someone asks 'what am I signing'…"
---
## Framework: Severity Scale
- 🔴 Can cost you real money — auto-renewal into a full new term, break
  penalties beyond re-rental costs, deposit conditions written to fail…
```

That's the whole trick: it's markdown. Your agent reads it and gains the judgment; you can read it too, audit it, edit it, or [write your own](SKILL-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md). No lock-in, no runtime, no telemetry.

## 💸 Cut your token bill

The **[pm-tokens](plugins/pm-tokens)** bundle optimizes every stage of your agent's token journey — no API keys, stdlib Python, nothing leaves your machine. Five habits, typically **30–60% off a session's token flow**:

```bash
# 1. Map the repo instead of reading it (~3% of the cost of reading everything)
python3 skills/repo-map/scripts/repo_map.py .

# 2. Crush bulk before it enters context (98% smaller on uniform JSON; errors always survive)
python3 skills/context-crusher/scripts/context_crush.py --mode json --file response.json

# 3. Measure what anything costs — at YOUR prices, times YOUR call volume
python3 skills/token-cost/scripts/token_cost.py --file CLAUDE.md --price-in 3 --calls 200
```

Plus the judgment skills: [token-diet](skills/token-diet/SKILL.md) (output costs 3–5× input — diet it where safe), [context-budget](skills/context-budget/SKILL.md) (cache-aware layout: stable first, volatile last), and [session-handoff](skills/session-handoff/SKILL.md) (resume at ~5% of transcript size). **The full how-to: [docs/SAVE-TOKENS.md](docs/SAVE-TOKENS.md).**

## ✅ Quality, not just quantity

- **Every skill passes the [SkillSpec](SKILLSPEC.md) L3 gate** — structure, framework, quality checks, anti-patterns — enforced in CI on every commit
- **[Eval-scored](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/leaderboard.html)** — 208 scored outputs, avg 4.8/5, judged blind
- **Security-audited** — a dedicated CI workflow sweeps every skill and script; calculators are stdlib-only and deterministic with byte-exact output tests
- **Honest by design** — decoders end with a not-legal-advice line, calculators name what they don't model, simulators debrief out of character, and skills that shouldn't ghostwrite (student statements) coach instead
