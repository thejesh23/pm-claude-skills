## 🤖 Building Blocks for Agent Templates

On May 5, 2026, Anthropic [released their first agent templates](https://www.anthropic.com/news/finance-agents) — pre-packaged Claude agents that combine **skills, connectors, and subagents** into ready-to-run workflows for financial services.

This library is the largest open-source collection of professional skills available — covering 15 professions beyond financial services. **The 106 skills here are the building blocks for agent templates outside of finance.**

### What is an agent template?

An agent template packages three things into one runnable workflow:

| Component | What it is | Example from this library |
|---|---|---|
| **Skills** | Markdown files that teach Claude how to produce structured professional outputs | `sprint-planning`, `contract-review`, `investor-update` |
| **Connectors** | Governed access to your team's data sources | Linear, Jira, Slack, Google Drive, Notion |
| **Subagents** | Focused Claude models for sub-tasks within the larger workflow | Capacity analyst, risk scorer, comparables selector |

A skill alone gives Claude a structured output format. An agent template gives Claude a complete workflow — pulling data, running specialised analysis, producing the output, and routing it where it needs to go.

### How to use this library to build your own agent template

Pick a recurring workflow on your team. Identify which existing skills cover the structured outputs that workflow needs. Add the connectors that let Claude reach the data. Add subagents for the analytical sub-tasks. That's the template.

Examples of agent templates this library supports:

| Template | Skills used | Connectors needed | Subagents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PM Sprint Agent** | sprint-planning, sprint-brief, retro, project-status-report | Linear or Jira, Slack | Capacity analyst, risk scorer |
| **Legal Contract Review Agent** | contract-review, nda-analyser, compliance-checklist | Google Drive or SharePoint | Clause-by-clause risk scorer |
| **PM Discovery Agent** | discovery-interview-guide, user-interview-synthesis, assumption-mapper | Granola or Otter, Notion | Theme synthesiser |
| **Sales Pursuit Agent** | sales-battlecard, discovery-call-prep, proposal-writer, account-plan | Salesforce or HubSpot, Gong | Competitive intel analyst |
| **HR Onboarding Agent** | onboarding-plan, job-description-writer, change-management-plan | Workday or BambooHR, Slack | First-week scheduler |
| **Finance Board Pack Agent** | investor-update, board-deck-narrative, financial-model-narrative | NetSuite or Xero, Google Drive | KPI variance analyst |
| **Marketing Launch Agent** | go-to-market, content-calendar, email-campaign, media-pitch | HubSpot, Notion | Channel strategist |

### First template available now

The first agent template built from this library — **PM Sprint Agent** — is available in the [`templates/pm-sprint-agent/`](./templates/pm-sprint-agent/) directory. It combines four skills, two connectors, and two subagents into a single workflow that handles end-to-end sprint planning.

Documentation, working orchestration script, and example outputs are included in the template folder.

More templates will follow. If you want to contribute one, see the [template contribution guide](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Skill Title

[Instructions for Claude to follow when this skill is invoked]


**What makes a good skill:**
- Solves a recurring professional workflow (not a one-off task)
- Has a clear trigger description so Claude knows when to activate it
- Produces consistent, structured output
- Works without needing extensive setup or context

| Skill | Profession | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `grant-report` | Non-profit | Funder progress reports against grant objectives |
| `architectural-spec` | Architecture | Project specifications and technical drawing briefs |
| `clinical-guideline-summary` | Healthcare | Plain English summaries of clinical guidelines |
| `pitch-deck-feedback` | Startup | Investor-perspective critique of a pitch deck |

## 🤖 Companion Repository — ChatGPT Custom GPTs

If you use ChatGPT instead of Claude Code, there's a companion repo with the same professional frameworks built as Custom GPT system prompts:

**[professional-gpt-library](https://github.com/mohitagw15856/professional-gpt-library)** — 10 starter GPTs across 8 professions, MIT licence.

Read the full breakdown: [Part 12 — I Built the Same Skills Library for ChatGPT](https://medium.com/product-powerhouse/i-built-the-same-skills-library-for-chatgpt-heres-what-s-different-a9305f9c20b9)

## 🛠️ Custom Skills for Your Team

The 106 skills in this library are built for general professional workflows. But the most powerful version of Claude Skills is one built specifically for *your* team — your templates, your terminology, your processes, your quality standards.

**What custom skills look like in practice:**

- A law firm's contract review skill trained on their specific clause library and risk tolerance
- A SaaS company's sprint brief skill that knows their engineering conventions and definition of done
- A finance team's board pack skill that follows their exact narrative structure and slide format
- An HR team's job description skill that reflects their values language and includes their specific benefits

The difference between a generic skill and one built for your context is significant. Generic skills eliminate the blank page. Custom skills eliminate the rework.

**If you want skills built for your team's specific workflows — [get in touch](mailto:mohit15856@gmail.com).**

Include a brief description of your team, the workflows you want to automate, and the tools you use. I'll come back to you within 48 hours.

## 📖 How Skills Work

Skills are markdown files that Claude reads dynamically. When you describe a task, Claude scans available skill descriptions (~100 tokens) and loads the full skill only when relevant. This means:

- Skills are efficient — they only use tokens when triggered
- Multiple skills can coexist without slowing Claude down
- Personal skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) work across all your projects
- Plugin skills install via the Claude Code marketplace with one command
