## 🤖 Building Blocks for Agent Templates

On May 5, 2026, Anthropic [released their first agent templates](https://www.anthropic.com/news/finance-agents) — pre-packaged Claude agents that combine **skills, connectors, and subagents** into ready-to-run workflows for financial services.

This library is the largest open-source collection of professional skills available — covering 15 professions beyond financial services. **The 106 skills here are the building blocks for agent templates outside of finance.**

### What is an agent template?

An agent template packages three things into one runnable workflow:

| Component | What it is | Example from this library |
|---|---|---|
| **Skills** | Markdown files that teach Claude how to produce structured professional outputs | `sprint-planning`, `contract-review`, `investor-update` |
| **Connectors** | Governed access to your team's data sources | Linear, Jira, Slack, Google Drive, Notion |
| **Subagents** | Focused Claude models for sub-tasks within the larger workflow | Capacity analyst, risk scorer, comparables selector |

A skill alone gives Claude a structured output format. An agent template gives Claude a complete workflow — pulling data, running specialised analysis, producing the output, and routing it where it needs to go.

### How to use this library to build your own agent template

Pick a recurring workflow on your team. Identify which existing skills cover the structured outputs that workflow needs. Add the connectors that let Claude reach the data. Add subagents for the analytical sub-tasks. That's the template.

Examples of agent templates this library supports:

| Template | Skills used | Connectors needed | Subagents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PM Sprint Agent** | sprint-planning, sprint-brief, retro, project-status-report | Linear or Jira, Slack | Capacity analyst, risk scorer |
| **Legal Contract Review Agent** | contract-review, nda-analyser, compliance-checklist | Google Drive or SharePoint | Clause-by-clause risk scorer |
| **PM Discovery Agent** | discovery-interview-guide, user-interview-synthesis, assumption-mapper | Granola or Otter, Notion | Theme synthesiser |
| **Sales Pursuit Agent** | sales-battlecard, discovery-call-prep, proposal-writer, account-plan | Salesforce or HubSpot, Gong | Competitive intel analyst |
| **HR Onboarding Agent** | onboarding-plan, job-description-writer, change-management-plan | Workday or BambooHR, Slack | First-week scheduler |
| **Finance Board Pack Agent** | investor-update, board-deck-narrative, financial-model-narrative | NetSuite or Xero, Google Drive | KPI variance analyst |
| **Marketing Launch Agent** | go-to-market, content-calendar, email-campaign, media-pitch | HubSpot, Notion | Channel strategist |


### Available agent templates

The pm-claude-skills library now includes four working agent templates, each built from existing skills in this library combined with subagents and connectors. All four follow the architecture Anthropic introduced for [financial services agent templates](https://www.anthropic.com/news/finance-agents) on May 5, 2026.

| Template | What it does | Skills used | Connectors | Time saved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[PM Sprint Agent](./templates/pm-sprint-agent/)** | End-to-end sprint planning — pulls backlog, calculates capacity, drafts plan, scores risks | sprint-planning, sprint-brief | Linear, Jira | 90 min → 90 sec |
| **[PM Discovery Agent](./templates/pm-discovery-agent/)** | Customer discovery synthesis — reads interview notes, finds themes, scores assumption confidence | user-interview-synthesis, job-story-mapper | Notion, Google Drive | 1 day → 5 min |
| **[PM Stakeholder Comms Agent](./templates/pm-stakeholder-comms-agent/)** | Audience-tailored stakeholder updates — exec, investor, cross-functional, or board | executive-update, investor-update, stakeholder-update, board-deck-narrative | Linear, Jira, Google Drive | 90 min → 1 min |
| **[PM Launch Agent](./templates/pm-launch-agent/)** | End-to-end launch coordination — content for every channel, calendar, metrics, checklist | go-to-market, content-calendar, media-pitch, email-campaign, launch-checklist | Notion (optional) | 4-6 hours → 3 min |

Each template includes:
- Working orchestration script
- Two or more focused subagents
- Connector configurations with documented setup
- Working examples (input + output)
- Smoke test for verifying installations

### How to install a template

All templates are part of the main library — installing the marketplace gives you all four.

/plugin marketplace add mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills


Then navigate to the template you want and follow its README:

cd templates/pm-sprint-agent      # or pm-discovery-agent, etc.
cat README.md                       # full setup instructions


### Building your own template

If you want to build a template for a workflow not covered above — Legal Contract Review, Sales Pursuit, Finance Board Pack, HR Onboarding, Marketing Campaign — see the [template contribution guide](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The pattern is consistent: pick a multi-step workflow, identify which existing skills cover the structured outputs, add connectors for data access, and define subagents for specialised analysis. The four templates above are reference implementations.


It combines four skills, two connectors, and two subagents into a single workflow that handles end-to-end sprint planning.

Documentation, working orchestration script, and example outputs are included in the template folder.

More templates will follow. If you want to contribute one, see the [template contribution guide](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 🤖 Companion Repository — ChatGPT Custom GPTs

If you use ChatGPT instead of Claude Code, there's a companion repo with the same professional frameworks built as Custom GPT system prompts:

**[professional-gpt-library](https://github.com/mohitagw15856/professional-gpt-library)** — 10 starter GPTs across 8 professions, MIT licence.

Read the full breakdown: [Part 12 — I Built the Same Skills Library for ChatGPT](https://medium.com/product-powerhouse/i-built-the-same-skills-library-for-chatgpt-heres-what-s-different-a9305f9c20b9)

## 🛠️ Custom Skills for Your Team

The 114 skills in this library are built for general professional workflows. But the most powerful version of Claude Skills is one built specifically for *your* team — your templates, your terminology, your processes, your quality standards.

**What custom skills look like in practice:**

- A law firm's contract review skill trained on their specific clause library and risk tolerance
- A SaaS company's sprint brief skill that knows their engineering conventions and definition of done
- A finance team's board pack skill that follows their exact narrative structure and slide format
- An HR team's job description skill that reflects their values language and includes their specific benefits

The difference between a generic skill and one built for your context is significant. Generic skills eliminate the blank page. Custom skills eliminate the rework.

**If you want skills built for your team's specific workflows — [get in touch](mailto:mohit15856@gmail.com).**

Include a brief description of your team, the workflows you want to automate, and the tools you use. I'll come back to you within 48 hours.

## 📖 How Skills Work

Skills are markdown files that Claude reads dynamically. When you describe a task, Claude scans available skill descriptions (~100 tokens) and loads the full skill only when relevant. This means:

- Skills are efficient — they only use tokens when triggered
- Multiple skills can coexist without slowing Claude down
- Personal skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) work across all your projects
- Plugin skills install via the Claude Code marketplace with one command
