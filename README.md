## 🔌 Works With — Cross-Tool Compatibility

These skills were built for Claude Code, but they aren't locked to it. Each `SKILL.md` is
two portable parts: a small **frontmatter** block (`name` + `description`) and a
**markdown body** that is just a well-structured set of instructions and output templates.
The body is plain English — so it works anywhere a capable model reads instructions.

There are two kinds of support. **Native `SKILL.md` agents** read the file as-is and
auto-discover skills from the `description` frontmatter. **Other tools** take the markdown
body as a system prompt — for those we ship ready-made [exports](#ready-to-use-exports).

| Platform | How it works | Auto-trigger? |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (CLI / desktop / web / IDE) | Native. Install via the plugin marketplace; Claude loads a skill automatically when your request matches its description. | ✅ Yes |
| **Hermes Agent** (Nous Research) | Native — same open `SKILL.md` standard. Run `python3 scripts/sync-hermes-skills.py` to install into `~/.hermes/skills/`; Hermes auto-discovers them. | ✅ Yes |
| **OpenAI Codex · OpenClaw** | Native `SKILL.md`. One-line install (see [below](#one-line-install-for-coding-agents)) or `./scripts/install.sh --agent codex`. | ✅ Yes |
| **Cursor** | Generated `.mdc` rules → `.cursor/rules/`. `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent cursor`. | ⚙️ By description |
| **Windsurf** | Generated `.md` workspace rules → `.windsurf/rules/`. `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent windsurf`. | ⚙️ By description |
| **Aider** | Generated conventions files you load with `aider --read`. `npx pm-claude-skills add --agent aider`. | ⚙️ `--read` |
| **MCP clients** (Claude Desktop, Cline, …) | Run the [MCP server](mcp/) — the assistant searches & pulls skills on demand via `npx -y pm-claude-skills-mcp`. | ✅ On demand |
| **Claude.ai & Claude API** | Upload a skill, or paste the body in as a system prompt / project instruction. | ⚙️ Manual |
| **ChatGPT & Gemini** | Copy a ready-made [export](#ready-to-use-exports) into a Custom GPT or Gem's instructions. You keep the full framework and output format. | ❌ Paste per use |

**What's verified vs. what varies:** the skill **bodies** — the frameworks, rubrics, and
output templates that do the actual work — are model-agnostic and have been used across
Claude and other chat LLMs. Native `SKILL.md` agents (Claude Code, Hermes) also get the
convenience layer: automatic skill discovery from the `description`. On chat LLMs you paste
the body in manually and lose only the auto-triggering, not the substance.

### Ready-to-use exports

You don't have to strip frontmatter by hand. Every skill is exported to platform-ready
files under [`exports/`](exports/), generated from the same source so nothing is
maintained twice:

- **ChatGPT** — copy any [`exports/chatgpt/<bundle>/<skill>/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`](exports/chatgpt/) straight into a Custom GPT's instructions.
- **Google Gemini** — copy any [`exports/gemini/<bundle>/<skill>/GEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](exports/gemini/) into a Gem's instructions.
- **Cursor** (`.mdc`) · **Windsurf** (`.md`) · **Aider** (`.md`) — generated rule/conventions files in [`exports/cursor/`](exports/cursor/), [`exports/windsurf/`](exports/windsurf/), [`exports/aider/`](exports/aider/) (or use the installers below).

### One-command install for coding agents

**Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) — recommended.** One Node command installs every skill where your agent discovers them. No git, no bash:

```bash
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent claude     # skills + subagents + commands → ~/.claude/
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent codex      # OpenAI Codex (or: hermes · openclaw)
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent cursor     # .mdc rules → ./.cursor/rules
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent windsurf   # .md rules → ./.windsurf/rules
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent aider      # conventions → load with: aider --read
npx pm-claude-skills list                   # all supported agents + default paths
```

Add `--link` (symlink), `--target <path>`, or `--dry-run` to any `add`.

**Shell one-liners** (macOS / Linux / Git Bash / WSL — *not* PowerShell):

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/main/scripts/codex-install.sh)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/main/scripts/openclaw-install.sh)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/main/scripts/cursor-install.sh)
```

> **Windows / PowerShell:** use the `npx` command above (the `bash <(curl …)` form is a Unix idiom and won't run in PowerShell).

Already cloned? `./scripts/install.sh --agent <name>` (or `python3 scripts/sync-hermes-skills.py` for Hermes) does the same from your checkout.

The skill body in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is the single source of truth. Regenerate the
chat-LLM / Cursor exports (or add a new platform — it's a few lines in the `PLATFORMS` registry) with:

```bash
node scripts/build-exports.mjs            # regenerate all platform exports
node scripts/build-exports.mjs --check    # CI: fail if exports are stale
```

> Prefer a hand-curated ChatGPT collection? There's also a [companion Custom GPT library](#-companion-repository--chatgpt-custom-gpts) built from the same frameworks.

## 🤖 Subagents & Slash Commands

It's not just skills. The library also ships **Claude Code subagents** and **slash commands** built on top of the strongest skills, so common workflows are one delegation or one command away.

**Subagents** ([`agents/`](agents/)) — focused personas Claude delegates to automatically by description:

| Agent | Use it for |
|---|---|
| [`pm-partner`](agents/pm-partner.md) | PRDs, prioritisation, stakeholder updates, exec summaries |
| [`sprint-master`](agents/sprint-master.md) | Sprint planning, retros, velocity, user stories |
| [`cs-guardian`](agents/cs-guardian.md) | Account health, churn, renewals, escalations, QBRs |
| [`launch-captain`](agents/launch-captain.md) | Positioning, GTM, launch checklists, competitor teardowns |

**Slash commands** ([`commands/`](commands/)) — run a skill on whatever you pass:

`/prd` · `/rice` · `/sprint-plan` · `/health-scorecard` · `/retro` · `/exec-summary`

**Personas** ([`output-styles/`](output-styles/)) — Claude Code output styles that change the assistant's whole voice and default skill loadout. Switch with `/output-style`:

`Startup CTO` · `Growth Marketer` · `Solo Founder` · `Product Leader`

Install everything for Claude Code in one go (skills **+** subagents **+** commands **+** personas):

```bash
npx pm-claude-skills add --agent claude   # ~/.claude/{skills,agents,commands,output-styles}
```

Commands whose skill ships a Python helper (RICE, sprint capacity, customer health) run it to **compute** results, not estimate them. To string these together, see the [orchestration patterns](ORCHESTRATION.md) (skill chains & multi-agent handoffs).

## 🧩 MCP Server — Skills on Demand

For MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cline, …), there's a zero-dependency [**MCP server**](mcp/) so your assistant **searches and pulls skills on demand** instead of installing 172 files. It exposes three tools — `list_skills`, `search_skills`, `get_skill` — over stdio (no network, nothing leaves your machine).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pm-claude-skills": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "pm-claude-skills-mcp"] }
  }
}
```

Then ask: *"search the skills for customer churn, then apply the best one to my account."* Full setup in [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/).

## ⚙️ AI-Powered Tooling

Three ways to put the library to work beyond installing files:

**🤖 Run a skill in your CI — [GitHub Action](action/).** Auto-write PR descriptions, changelogs, release notes, or run a code-review checklist on every PR:

```yaml
- uses: mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/action@main
  with:
    skill: pr-description-writer
    input: ${{ steps.diff.outputs.text }}
    api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

**🏗️ Turn your docs into a skill — `generate`.** Point it at a URL or file and it writes a `SKILL.md` that follows the authoring standard:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-… npx pm-claude-skills generate --from ./team-process.md
```

**🏆 Skill Leaderboard — [evals](evals/).** An LLM-as-judge harness scores each skill across Claude models on structure, completeness, usefulness, and grounding. **[View the leaderboard →](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/leaderboard.html)**

## 🤖 Building Blocks for Agent Templates

On May 5, 2026, Anthropic [released their first agent templates](https://www.anthropic.com/news/finance-agents) — pre-packaged Claude agents that combine **skills, connectors, and subagents** into ready-to-run workflows for financial services.

This library is the largest open-source collection of professional skills available — covering 17 professions beyond financial services. **The 167 skills here are the building blocks for agent templates outside of finance.**

### What is an agent template?

An agent template packages three things into one runnable workflow:

| Component | What it is | Example from this library |
|---|---|---|
| **Skills** | Markdown files that teach Claude how to produce structured professional outputs | `sprint-planning`, `contract-review`, `investor-update` |
| **Connectors** | Governed access to your team's data sources | Linear, Jira, Slack, Google Drive, Notion |
| **Subagents** | Focused Claude models for sub-tasks within the larger workflow | Capacity analyst, risk scorer, comparables selector |

A skill alone gives Claude a structured output format. An agent template gives Claude a complete workflow — pulling data, running specialised analysis, producing the output, and routing it where it needs to go.

### How to use this library to build your own agent template

Pick a recurring workflow on your team. Identify which existing skills cover the structured outputs that workflow needs. Add the connectors that let Claude reach the data. Add subagents for the analytical sub-tasks. That's the template.

Examples of agent templates this library supports:

| Template | Skills used | Connectors needed | Subagents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PM Sprint Agent** | sprint-planning, sprint-brief, retro, project-status-report | Linear or Jira, Slack | Capacity analyst, risk scorer |
| **Legal Contract Review Agent** | contract-review, nda-analyser, compliance-checklist | Google Drive or SharePoint | Clause-by-clause risk scorer |
| **PM Discovery Agent** | discovery-interview-guide, user-interview-synthesis, assumption-mapper | Granola or Otter, Notion | Theme synthesiser |
| **Sales Pursuit Agent** | sales-battlecard, discovery-call-prep, proposal-writer, account-plan | Salesforce or HubSpot, Gong | Competitive intel analyst |
| **HR Onboarding Agent** | onboarding-plan, job-description-writer, change-management-plan | Workday or BambooHR, Slack | First-week scheduler |
| **Finance Board Pack Agent** | investor-update, board-deck-narrative, financial-model-narrative | NetSuite or Xero, Google Drive | KPI variance analyst |
| **Marketing Launch Agent** | go-to-market, content-calendar, email-campaign, media-pitch | HubSpot, Notion | Channel strategist |


### Available agent templates

The pm-claude-skills library now includes four working agent templates, each built from existing skills in this library combined with subagents and connectors. All four follow the architecture Anthropic introduced for [financial services agent templates](https://www.anthropic.com/news/finance-agents) on May 5, 2026.

| Template | What it does | Skills used | Connectors | Time saved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[PM Sprint Agent](./templates/pm-sprint-agent/)** | End-to-end sprint planning — pulls backlog, calculates capacity, drafts plan, scores risks | sprint-planning, sprint-brief | Linear, Jira | 90 min → 90 sec |
| **[PM Discovery Agent](./templates/pm-discovery-agent/)** | Customer discovery synthesis — reads interview notes, finds themes, scores assumption confidence | user-interview-synthesis, job-story-mapper | Notion, Google Drive | 1 day → 5 min |
| **[PM Stakeholder Comms Agent](./templates/pm-stakeholder-comms-agent/)** | Audience-tailored stakeholder updates — exec, investor, cross-functional, or board | executive-update, investor-update, stakeholder-update, board-deck-narrative | Linear, Jira, Google Drive | 90 min → 1 min |
| **[PM Launch Agent](./templates/pm-launch-agent/)** | End-to-end launch coordination — content for every channel, calendar, metrics, checklist | go-to-market, content-calendar, media-pitch, email-campaign, launch-checklist | Notion (optional) | 4-6 hours → 3 min |

Each template includes:
- Working orchestration script
- Two or more focused subagents
- Connector configurations with documented setup
- Working examples (input + output)
- Smoke test for verifying installations

### How to install a template

All templates are part of the main library — installing the marketplace gives you all four.

/plugin marketplace add mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills


Then navigate to the template you want and follow its README:

cd templates/pm-sprint-agent      # or pm-discovery-agent, etc.
cat README.md                       # full setup instructions


### Building your own template

If you want to build a template for a workflow not covered above — Legal Contract Review, Sales Pursuit, Finance Board Pack, HR Onboarding, Marketing Campaign — see the [template contribution guide](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The pattern is consistent: pick a multi-step workflow, identify which existing skills cover the structured outputs, add connectors for data access, and define subagents for specialised analysis. The four templates above are reference implementations.


It combines four skills, two connectors, and two subagents into a single workflow that handles end-to-end sprint planning.

Documentation, working orchestration script, and example outputs are included in the template folder.

More templates will follow. If you want to contribute one, see the [template contribution guide](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 📋 Changelog

The highlights are below. For the structured, [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)-format history, see **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**.

### 🆕 What's New in v20.1.0 — Star Nudges & Eval Hardening

- **Star the repo, from anywhere you use it** — tasteful, non-spammy CTAs (no `postinstall`): after a successful `npx pm-claude-skills add`, in `--help`, in `list`, in the MCP server banner, below the README badges, and a `funding` link on npm.
- **One-click leaderboard in CI** — the "Update Skill Leaderboard" workflow runs the evals with your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret and opens a results PR; merge it to publish real numbers.
- **Faster, hang-proof evals** — per-request timeout + retries in the API client and concurrent eval runs, so a CI run finishes in minutes and can't stall.

<details>
<summary><strong>v20.0.0 — Agentic Tooling</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

The library starts *doing* the work, not just describing it:

- **GitHub Action** ([`action/`](action/)) — run any skill in a repo's CI (auto PR descriptions, changelogs, release notes, reviews). `uses: mohitagw15856/pm-claude-skills/action@main`. We dogfood it to write this repo's own PR descriptions.
- **`generate` command** — `npx pm-claude-skills generate --from <url|file>` turns your docs into a standard-compliant `SKILL.md`.
- **Skill evals + Leaderboard** — LLM-as-judge scoring of skills across models, rendered as a public [leaderboard](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/leaderboard.html).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>v19.0.0 — Security Auditor, Personas & Catalog</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

- **Skill Security Auditor** — scans every skill (and its scripts) for prompt injection, exfiltration, unsafe code, secrets, hidden text; HIGH fails CI. Plus a `skill-security-auditor` skill.
- **4 personas** (output-styles), an [orchestration guide](ORCHESTRATION.md), a server-rendered **skill catalog**, and a public [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>v18.0.0 — Windsurf, Aider & an MCP Server</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

- **Two more install targets** — **Windsurf** and **Aider** (now 5 export platforms / 7 tools).
- **MCP server** (`npx pm-claude-skills-mcp`) — search & pull skills on demand from MCP clients.
- **Automated npm publishing** workflow; README hero demo placement.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>v17.0.0 — Agents, Commands & the npx CLI</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

The library grows past "just skills" and gets one-command, cross-platform install:

- **`npx pm-claude-skills add --agent <tool>`** — a cross-platform Node installer (Windows/macOS/Linux, no bash, no git).
- **4 Claude Code subagents** (`agents/`) and **6 slash commands** (`commands/`); `--agent claude` installs skills + agents + commands together.
- **Cursor `.mdc` exports**, a **SkillCheck validator** + CI badge, and a **skill scaffolder** (`npm run new-skill`).
- **One-line shell installers** plus a unified `scripts/install.sh`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>v16.0.0 — Multi-Platform</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

The library stops being Claude-only and becomes a portable, single-source-of-truth project:

- **Runs on more platforms.** Native install for **Hermes Agent** (same open `SKILL.md` standard), plus ready-to-paste **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** exports generated from every skill.
- **One source, many targets.** `scripts/build-exports.mjs` renders per-platform files from each `SKILL.md` body — nothing maintained twice — with a `PLATFORMS` registry and a CI guard that fails on drift.
- **Three stdlib Python helpers** for flagship skills (sprint capacity, RICE scoring, customer-health scoring).
- **Explicit skill tiers** (`TIERS.md` + `skill-tiers.json`) and an **upgraded Skill Playground** (tier filter + "use in another tool" copy panel).
- **Repo hygiene**: `CHANGELOG.md`, `SKILL-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md`, refreshed `SECURITY.md`, `.gitignore`, Related Projects.

</details>

## 🏷️ Skill Tiers — Start With the Strongest

A 170+ skill library doesn't have 170 equally-mature skills, and pretending otherwise
wastes your time. Skills are tiered honestly so you can start with the best work:

- 🟢 **Production-Ready (47)** — battle-tested, stable output, used in real work. Includes the three skills with computed Python helpers (sprint planning, RICE, customer health). **Start here.**
- 🔵 **Stable** — solid, reliable, well-structured; the default for most of the library.
- 🟡 **Experimental** — newer or dependent on an external tool/API/scrape (Gemini, Gmail, browser automation, social scraping). Useful, but more setup and more moving parts.

**👉 Full breakdown: [TIERS.md](TIERS.md)** — every Production-Ready and Experimental skill listed by name.

If you're new, install `pm-essentials` and try a couple of Production-Ready skills before going wide.

## 🤝 Contributing — Add Your Skill

This is an open-source community library. If you've built a skill that saves you time, share it here.

**New here?** See the [Roadmap & good first issues](ROADMAP.md#-good-first-issues) for starter tasks. **Found a bug?** [Open a bug report →](../../issues/new?template=bug-report.md).

**How to contribute:**

1. Fork this repo
2. Scaffold a skill that already passes validation: `npm run new-skill -- --name your-skill-name`
   (or copy the template below into `skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md`)
3. Fill in the sections, then check it: `npm run skillcheck`
4. Raise a pull request with a short description of what the skill does and why you built it

> Every PR is gated by **SkillCheck** (structure — `node scripts/skillcheck.mjs`) and the **Skill Security Auditor** (safety — `node scripts/skill-audit.mjs`, which flags prompt-injection / exfiltration / unsafe code). Both must pass.

## 🛠️ Custom Skills for Your Team

The 155 skills in this library are built for general professional workflows. But the most powerful version of Claude Skills is one built specifically for *your* team — your templates, your terminology, your processes, your quality standards.

**What custom skills look like in practice:**

- A law firm's contract review skill trained on their specific clause library and risk tolerance
- A SaaS company's sprint brief skill that knows their engineering conventions and definition of done
- A finance team's board pack skill that follows their exact narrative structure and slide format
- An HR team's job description skill that reflects their values language and includes their specific benefits

The difference between a generic skill and one built for your context is significant. Generic skills eliminate the blank page. Custom skills eliminate the rework.

**If you want skills built for your team's specific workflows — [get in touch](mailto:mohit15856@gmail.com).**

Include a brief description of your team, the workflows you want to automate, and the tools you use. I'll come back to you within 48 hours.

---

## 📖 How Skills Work

Skills are markdown files that Claude reads dynamically. When you describe a task, Claude scans available skill descriptions (~100 tokens) and loads the full skill only when relevant. This means:

- Skills are efficient — they only use tokens when triggered
- Multiple skills can coexist without slowing Claude down
- Personal skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) work across all your projects
- Plugin skills install via the Claude Code marketplace with one command
