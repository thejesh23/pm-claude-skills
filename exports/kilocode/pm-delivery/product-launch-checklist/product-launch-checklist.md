# Product Launch Checklist Skill

Never launch without checking everything. Generate a complete, role-assigned checklist covering pre-launch readiness, launch day execution, and post-launch monitoring.

## Proposes Actions

Once the checklist is approved, it can be *executed*: hand the items to [`action-runner`](../action-runner/SKILL.md), which previews them (dry-run, risk-rated), runs only what you approve via the connected action MCP (GitHub/Linear/Slack), and records what was done back to the brain. Typical: **open an issue per checklist item** in the named repo/project (🟡), and **post the launch summary to Slack** (🔴 — approved individually). This skill proposes; action-runner gates and runs — never silently.

## Required Inputs

Ask the user for these if not provided:
- **Launch name** and planned launch date
- **Launch tier** (1 = major product launch, 2 = significant feature release, 3 = incremental update)
- **Team members and their roles** (engineering lead, PM, marketing, support, etc.)
- **Feature description** (what is being launched)
- **Rollback capability** (can this be feature-flagged or reverted quickly?)

## Reads from / Writes to the Brain

If a [`professional-brain`](../professional-brain/SKILL.md) (`brain/`) exists, use it before asking:

- **Read first:** the `entities/` feature being launched and related `decisions/` (scope, dates, owners).
- **Write after:** log launch decisions and owners to `decisions/`. This skill can also hand the checklist to [`action-runner`](../action-runner/SKILL.md) to file the tickets — which records what was actually done back to the brain, closing the loop.

## How to Use This Skill

Provide:
- Launch name and date
- Launch tier (1 = major, 2 = feature, 3 = incremental)
- Team members and their roles

The skill generates a tiered checklist. Tier 3 launches use only the Essentials section. Tier 2 adds Marketing & Comms. Tier 1 uses all sections.

### 📈 POST-LAUNCH (D+7, D+30)
- [ ] D+7 metrics review: adoption, errors, support tickets
- [ ] D+7 customer feedback synthesised
- [ ] Retrospective scheduled
- [ ] Learnings documented
- [ ] D+30 success metrics reviewed against targets
- [ ] Feature flag removed from codebase (clean up)
- [ ] Follow-up features added to backlog based on feedback

---

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Launch tier confirmed before generating checklist (scope determines depth)
- [ ] Go/No-Go decision has a named owner and a specific decision time
- [ ] Rollback procedure is documented and tested (not just planned)
- [ ] Feature flag expansion is staged (5% → 50% → 100%), not all-at-once
- [ ] Post-launch retrospective is scheduled at launch time

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not apply a Tier 1 checklist to an incremental update — tier the launch appropriately before generating the checklist
- [ ] Do not launch on a Friday without confirmed weekend engineering coverage
- [ ] Do not leave the Go/No-Go decision owner as "the team" — it must be a named individual
- [ ] Do not skip the rollback plan for Tier 1 and 2 launches — know the revert time before going live
- [ ] Do not close the launch without scheduling the post-launch retrospective — it must be booked at launch time, not after

## Guidelines

- The Go/No-Go decision must have a named owner — "the team" is not an owner
- Never launch on a Friday unless you have weekend engineering coverage
- Recommend starting all launches at <10% traffic — even for simple features
- Document rollback time: "We can revert this in X minutes" should be known before launch
