# Multi-Platform Exports

These folders are **generated** from the canonical `skills/*/SKILL.md` files —
the skill body is the single source of truth. Do not edit anything in `exports/`
by hand; edit the source skill and run:

```bash
node scripts/build-exports.mjs
```

Currently exporting **749 skills** to:

- **ChatGPT — Custom GPT instructions** → `exports/chatgpt/`
- **Google Gemini — Gem instructions** → `exports/gemini/`
- **Cursor — project rule (.mdc)** → `exports/cursor/`
- **Windsurf — workspace rule (.md)** → `exports/windsurf/`
- **Aider — conventions file (.md)** → `exports/aider/`
- **Cline — .clinerules/ rule (.md)** → `exports/cline/`
- **Continue.dev — rule (.md)** → `exports/continue/`
- **Zed — .rules file (.md)** → `exports/zed/`
- **Roo Code — .roo/rules/ rule (.md)** → `exports/roo/`
- **Kilo Code — .kilocode/rules/ rule (.md)** → `exports/kilocode/`
- **Obsidian — vault skill note (AI-plugin prompt)** → `exports/obsidian/`
- **OpenClaw — native SKILL.md with metadata block** → `exports/openclaw/`

Adding a new platform is a few lines in the `PLATFORMS` registry of
`scripts/build-exports.mjs` — no content is duplicated.
