# Savings Goal Plan Skill

"I want to save for X" becomes real when it has a number per month and a date. This skill turns a savings goal
into a concrete **funding plan** — the monthly amount needed, the timeline, milestones to stay motivated, and
an honest reckoning if the goal and the deadline don't fit. Educational, not personalized financial advice.

## Required Inputs

Ask for these only if they aren't already provided:

- **The goal & target amount** — what they're saving for and how much (or help estimate it).
- **Deadline or monthly capacity** — either a target date, or how much they can set aside per month.
- **Starting point** — anything already saved toward it.
- **Account context** (optional) — where it'll sit (e.g. a high-yield savings account), any interest.

## Output Format

### Savings plan — [goal]

**Target:** $X by [date] · **Already saved:** $Y · **To go:** $Z

**Required monthly contribution:** **$M/month** for N months (with a one-line note if modest interest changes it).

**Timeline & milestones**

| Milestone | Amount | Approx. date |
|---|---|---|
| 25% there | $ | |
| 50% there | $ | |
| 100% — goal! | $ | |

**Reality check** — does $M/month fit their budget? If the target date forces an unrealistic monthly amount, show the trade-off explicitly:
- Push the date to [later] → $ lower/month, or
- Cut the target to $ → fits $/month, or
- Find $ more/month from [where].

**Keep-it-on-track tips** — automate the transfer on payday; keep this goal in a separate/labeled account; what to do with windfalls.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] The required monthly contribution is calculated and tied to the deadline (or vice versa)
- [ ] Money already saved is subtracted from the target
- [ ] Milestones break the goal into motivating chunks with dates
- [ ] If the goal is unrealistic for the timeline, the trade-offs are shown in numbers
- [ ] Automation / separate-account advice is included

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not give a monthly number without checking it's realistic against their means
- [ ] Do not ignore money already saved or any starting balance
- [ ] Do not assume an interest rate without saying so — be conservative
- [ ] Do not present a single rigid plan when the date is too tight — offer the trade-off levers
- [ ] Do not present this as personalized financial advice

## Based On

Goal-based saving (sinking funds): target ÷ timeline, milestone tracking, and automated contributions.
