description: "Build an all-hands that lands with everyone from intern to VP — the mixed-altitude structure (the story for all, the numbers for some), the wins-with-names section done right, the hard-news slide handled straight, and the Q&A design that gets real questions. Use when asked build the all-hands deck, make the monthly town hall not boring, how do we share the numbers with everyone, or announce this change at all-hands. Produces the segment structure, the altitude-mixed content rules, the hard-news handling, and the Q&A mechanics."

# All Hands Deck Skill

The all-hands serves the widest audience in the company — new hires and executives, engineers and sales, the anxious and the checked-out — and decks built for any single altitude lose the rest: pure strategy bores the floor, pure metrics baffle the new, pure celebration reads as evasion in a hard quarter. The working structure mixes altitudes deliberately (the story everyone follows, the numbers that keep trust, the wins with *names*, the hard news handled straight), and treats the Q&A as a designed segment — because the questions people actually have determine what the meeting was *about*, whatever the slides said.

## What This Skill Produces

- **The segment structure** — the recurring skeleton: the narrative open, numbers, wins-with-names, the focus segment, hard news when owed, Q&A
- **The altitude rules** — per segment: what the newest hire needs vs. what the veterans check
- **The hard-news handling** — straight, early, with the what-it-means-for-you answered before it's asked
- **The Q&A mechanics** — pre-submitted + live, the no-softball discipline, and the answer-or-commit rule

## Required Inputs

Ask for these if not provided:
- **The month's material** — the numbers, the wins, the news (including the uncomfortable); the deck is assembled from reality, and the temptation to skip the bad month is the trust-killer to resist
- **The company's current mood** — post-layoff, post-win, mid-uncertainty; the structure holds but the emphasis calibrates (anxious companies need the hard-news slide *more* prominent, not less)
- **The metrics that recur** — the same 4–6 every time ([kpi-tracker-design](../kpi-tracker-design/SKILL.md) discipline: trends visible, definitions stable), because rotating metrics read as narrative management
- **The Q&A history** — what got asked last time, what went unanswered; unanswered questions compound

## Framework: The Structure Rules

1. **Open with the story, one slide:** the month in one narrative sentence ("we shipped the platform bet and paid for it in support load — here's both") — the frame everyone, at every altitude, carries through the numbers. Openings that jump to dashboards ask the floor to build their own narrative, and they build worse ones.
2. **The same numbers, trended, every time:** the recurring 4–6 metrics with their history visible ([data-slide-design](../data-slide-design/SKILL.md) rules) — consistency is the trust mechanism; a metric that vanishes the month it dipped teaches everyone to read absences. Down months get shown *with the same prominence* and one honest sentence of why.
3. **Wins carry names, and names rotate:** specific work by specific people ("the checkout rewrite — Ana, Jorge, and the platform team — cut latency 40%") — the recognition segment is half the meeting's retention value, and the rotation audit (who *hasn't* been named lately?) keeps it from becoming the same five people's highlight reel.
4. **Hard news goes early and straight:** the miss, the departure, the change — stated plainly in the deck's first half ([changelog-for-humans](../changelog-for-humans/SKILL.md) breaking-first logic), with the what-it-means-for-you slide answering the question every seat is silently asking. Bad news buried at slide 30, or worse left for Q&A extraction, converts one bad fact into a credibility debt.
5. **Q&A is designed, not appended:** pre-submitted questions (anonymous channel — the real ones need cover) mixed with live, the hardest pre-submitted question *taken first* (the signal that the segment is real), and the answer-or-commit rule: every question gets an answer or a named owner and date ("I don't know — [name] will post the answer by Friday"). The unanswered-question log is next month's open.

## Output Format

# All-Hands: [month] — [T] min

## The Structure
| Segment | Content | Altitude notes | Min |
|---|---|---|---|
[Story open (1 slide) · Numbers (the standing 4–6, trended) · Wins (names, rotated) · Focus topic · Hard news (early, if owed) · Q&A (designed)]

## Hard News Handling (when present)
[The plain statement · the what-it-means-for-you slide · placed at segment [early]]

## Q&A Mechanics
[The anonymous pre-submit channel · hardest-first rule · answer-or-commit with owners · last month's open questions, answered]

## Quality Checks

- [ ] The open is one narrative sentence, not a dashboard
- [ ] The metrics are the standing set, trended, shown in down months at full prominence
- [ ] Wins name people, and the rotation was checked
- [ ] Hard news appears early with the for-you slide
- [ ] Q&A takes the hardest pre-submitted question first, and last month's commits were honored

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not rotate metrics by convenience — the vanishing-metric tell reads louder than any bad number
- [ ] Do not celebrate through a hard month — the floor already knows; festivity reads as distance
- [ ] Do not thank "the whole team" generically — names or it's wallpaper
- [ ] Do not soften Q&A by selection — cherry-picked softballs teach people to stop submitting
- [ ] Do not leave commits unhonored — one forgotten "we'll get back to you" discounts every future one
