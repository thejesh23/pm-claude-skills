# Email Campaign Skill

This skill writes complete, sequenced email campaigns — from welcome flows to product launches to re-engagement sequences. Each email is written with subject line, preview text, full body copy, and CTA.

## Required Inputs

Ask the user for these if not provided:
- **Campaign goal** (onboard new users / launch a product / nurture leads / re-engage churned users / announce a feature)
- **Audience** (who receives this? job title, lifecycle stage, what they know already)
- **Product or offer** being promoted or introduced
- **Number of emails in sequence** (if unsure, recommend based on goal)
- **Tone** (professional / conversational / bold / educational)
- **Sender name** (person or brand?)

## Sequence Recommendations by Goal

If the user hasn't specified number of emails, use these defaults:
- **Onboarding:** 4 emails over 7 days (Day 0, Day 1, Day 3, Day 7)
- **Product launch:** 3 emails (Teaser → Launch Day → Follow-up/Last chance)
- **Lead nurture:** 5 emails over 2 weeks
- **Re-engagement:** 3 emails (Gentle nudge → Value reminder → Final offer)
- **Feature announcement:** 2 emails (Announcement → How-to/deep dive)

## Output Structure Per Email

For every email in the sequence, produce:

---

**Email [N] of [Total] — [Descriptive label e.g. "Welcome / Day 0"]**
**Send timing:** [When relative to trigger event or previous email]

**Subject line:** [Primary option]
**Subject line (A/B variant):** [Alternative to test]
**Preview text:** [40–90 characters — adds context to the subject, doesn't repeat it]

**Body:**

[Full email copy — formatted with clear opening line, 2–3 body paragraphs, one primary CTA]

**CTA button text:** [3–6 words]
**CTA destination:** [What page/action this should link to]

**Strategic note:** [Why this email does what it does — the psychological or strategic intent. 1–2 sentences.]

---

## Writing Rules

- Opening line must earn attention — no "Hi, welcome to [product]" openers
- Each email has ONE primary CTA — never two competing asks
- Keep paragraphs to 2–3 sentences maximum for mobile readability
- Use "you" more than "we" — centre the reader, not the brand
- Subject lines under 50 characters perform best on mobile — flag if going over
- Preview text should add information the subject doesn't — never just repeat it
- Every email should stand alone — assume some subscribers miss earlier emails

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Each email has a single clear CTA
- [ ] Subject lines are under 50 characters (or flagged)
- [ ] Preview text doesn't repeat the subject line
- [ ] Opening line is specific and attention-earning
- [ ] Sequence has logical narrative arc (doesn't feel like disconnected blasts)
- [ ] Tone is consistent across all emails
- [ ] Strategic notes explain the intent of each email

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not include more than one primary CTA per email — competing calls to action reduce click-through by splitting attention
- [ ] Do not open with "Hi, welcome to [product]" or any variation of a generic greeting — the opening line must earn attention immediately or recipients stop reading
- [ ] Do not write preview text that repeats the subject line — preview text is a second chance to earn the open, not a repeat of the first chance
- [ ] Do not write a sequence where each email restates the same value proposition — each email must advance the narrative or serve a distinct purpose in the buyer's journey
- [ ] Do not assume all subscribers receive all emails — each email must stand alone for subscribers who missed earlier messages in the sequence

## Example Trigger Phrases

- "Write a 3-email launch sequence for [product]"
- "Build an onboarding email flow for [SaaS tool]"
- "Create a drip campaign to nurture leads for [offer]"
- "Write a re-engagement campaign for churned users"
