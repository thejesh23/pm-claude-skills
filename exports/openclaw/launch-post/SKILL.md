# Launch Post Skill

Developers smell marketing from a mile away. A launch post that lands with them is concrete, honest about
trade-offs, and leads with *what it does and why you built it* — not adjectives. This skill writes that post
(Show HN, Product Hunt, dev blog, or a tweet thread), tuned to the channel, with title options and a strong
first comment to seed the discussion.

## Required Inputs

Ask for these only if they aren't already provided:

- **What you built** — the tool/library/API, in one plain sentence.
- **The problem & why now** — what was painful before; why you made it.
- **What's different** — how it compares to the obvious alternatives (honestly).
- **Proof** — a code snippet, benchmark, demo link, repo, or "how it works" detail.
- **Channel & ask** — Show HN / Product Hunt / blog / X thread, and what you want (feedback, stars, signups).

## Output Format

### [Channel] launch post

**Title options (3)** — concrete and specific; for Show HN follow the `Show HN: [Name] – [what it does]` form. No hype words.

**The post**
- **Opening (1–2 lines):** what it is and the problem it solves — no preamble.
- **Why we built it:** the honest origin / the gap in existing tools.
- **How it works / what's different:** the technical substance — a snippet or concrete detail beats claims.
- **Honest limits:** what it doesn't do yet, known trade-offs. (This *builds* credibility with devs.)
- **The ask:** try it / feedback / repo link — one clear next step.

**First comment (seed)** — a ready-to-post reply adding technical context or answering the obvious first question, to kick off discussion.

**Channel notes** — tweaks for the chosen channel (HN: no marketing tone, be in the thread to reply; PH: tagline + first comment; X: thread hook + cadence).

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Leads with what it does and the problem — not "excited to announce"
- [ ] Includes concrete proof (snippet, benchmark, demo, or how-it-works detail)
- [ ] Honestly states limits/trade-offs — credibility, not spin
- [ ] Title options are specific and channel-appropriate (e.g. correct Show HN format)
- [ ] One clear ask, and a first comment ready to seed the thread

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not use marketing hype ("revolutionary", "game-changing") — devs downvote it
- [ ] Do not hide limitations — naming them earns trust and pre-empts the top comment
- [ ] Do not bury the what-it-does under backstory — lead with substance
- [ ] Do not make claims without proof — show the code/benchmark/demo
- [ ] Do not write a generic post — tune tone and format to the actual channel

## Based On

Developer-launch craft (Show HN / Product Hunt norms): substance over hype, honest trade-offs, seed the discussion.
