description: "Escalate an issue up the chain without burning the person you're escalating past — the facts-first structure, the tried-already section that earns the escalation, and the specific ask that makes action easy. Use when asked I need to escalate this, write an email to my boss's boss, this vendor issue needs to go up, or how do I go over someone's head professionally. Produces the escalation email with its evidence spine, the pre-escalation courtesy step, and the relationship-preserving framing."

# Escalation Email Skill

Escalations fail in both directions: too soft (a vent that asks for nothing, filed as noise) or too hot (an ambush that makes an enemy at the layer you skipped). The working escalation is a *case*: what's stuck, what was already tried (this section earns the right to escalate), what it costs while stuck, and the one specific thing the recipient can do. And it's rarely a surprise attack — the person being escalated past usually gets told first, which converts most escalations into resolutions before they're even sent.

## What This Skill Produces

- **The escalation email** — facts-first, tried-already documented, cost stated, one specific ask
- **The courtesy step** — the heads-up to the person being escalated past, drafted (and the cases where it's skipped)
- **The evidence spine** — dates, attempts, responses, quoted where load-bearing
- **The de-escalation branch** — because the heads-up often resolves it, and that's the best outcome

## Required Inputs

Ask for these if not provided:
- **The stuck thing** — what's blocked, since when, what it's costing (time, money, a customer) — costs make escalations move
- **The attempts log** — what was tried, when, what came back; an escalation without attempts is just skipping the line
- **The players** — who's being escalated to, who's being escalated past, and the relationship texture with each
- **The ask** — the specific action the recipient can take ("approve the exception," "reassign the ticket," "a 15-minute decision meeting") — never "please advise"

## Framework: The Case Rules

1. **Facts first, temperature zero:** dates and events, no adjectives about people. "Requested on the 3rd, followed up on the 10th and 17th, no response" indicts nobody and proves everything. The reader assigns the blame themselves — more durably than you could.
2. **The tried-already section is the license:** two-to-three documented attempts through normal channels is what makes this an escalation instead of queue-jumping — and the section signals to the recipient that you escalate responsibly, which prices your *future* escalations.
3. **Cost converts sympathy to action:** "blocked" is a status; "blocked, costing us the Q3 window / $X a week / the customer's renewal confidence" is a priority. One quantified cost line, honest, no inflation.
4. **The ask is one action, sized for the recipient:** something they can do in their power in under a day. Multi-part asks and "thoughts?" both dissolve; "approve X" or "15 minutes to decide between A and B" both land.
5. **The courtesy heads-up:** "I'm going to raise this with [name] since we haven't been able to unblock it — wanted you to hear it from me" — sent to the escalated-past person first in most cases. It's respectful, it prevents the ambush grudge, and ~half the time it resolves the issue on its own. Skip it only where the escalation *is about* that person's conduct (then it goes up quietly, and possibly to HR-shaped channels instead).

## Output Format

# Escalation: [issue] → [recipient]

## The Courtesy Step (usually first)
[The heads-up draft · or the documented reason it's being skipped]

## The Email
[Subject: specific, not alarmed · Para 1: the situation + cost, two sentences · Para 2: the attempts, dated · Para 3: the one ask + timeline · warm close, zero blame-adjectives]

## Evidence Spine
[The dated attempt log, quotes attached where they carry weight]

## Quality Checks

- [ ] No adjectives about people — dates and events carry the case
- [ ] The attempts section shows 2+ real tries through normal channels
- [ ] The cost is quantified once, honestly
- [ ] The ask is one action within the recipient's power
- [ ] The escalated-past person hears it from you first (or the skip is justified explicitly)

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not vent — an escalation that asks for nothing is filed as mood
- [ ] Do not ambush — the surprise escalation buys one win and a permanent enemy
- [ ] Do not inflate the cost — the first discovered inflation discounts all your future cases
- [ ] Do not escalate without attempts — that's queue-jumping wearing a process word
- [ ] Do not cc the world — the recipient plus the minimum necessary; audience size reads as aggression
