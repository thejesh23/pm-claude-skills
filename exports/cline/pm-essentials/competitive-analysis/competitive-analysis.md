# Competitive Analysis Skill

Create structured competitive analyses for product decision-making.

## Required Inputs

Ask the user for these if not provided:
- **Your product or company** (what you're comparing against)
- **Competitors to analyze** (or ask to identify the top 3-5)
- **Analysis focus** (full landscape / feature comparison / pricing / positioning / win-loss)
- **Audience** (product team / leadership / sales / board)

## Process

1. Gather competitor information from provided inputs and available context
2. Build profiles for each competitor
3. Create feature comparison matrix on dimensions that matter to the user's customers
4. Analyze pricing and positioning
5. Identify win/loss patterns and strategic implications
6. **Validate** — Confirm all claims reference a specific source or are flagged as assumptions. Verify feature comparisons note quality differences, not just presence/absence.

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Market Position**: Where we stand relative to competitors
- **Key Findings**: Top 3-5 insights
- **Strategic Implications**: What this means for the roadmap

### 2. Competitor Profiles

For each competitor:
- **Company Overview**: Size, funding, market position
- **Target Customer**: Who they serve
- **Value Proposition**: Core positioning
- **Strengths / Weaknesses**: What they do well and where they fall short
- **Recent Activity**: Major updates, funding, announcements

### 3. Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|---------|-----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| [Feature] | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ None | ✅ Full |

Legend: ✅ Full (production-ready) · ⚠️ Limited/Beta · ❌ None

Include notes on quality and implementation differences where significant.

### 4. Pricing Comparison

| Plan | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| Free/Trial | [price] | [price] | [price] |
| Pro | [price] | [price] | [price] |
| Enterprise | [price] | [price] | [price] |

### 5. Market Positioning Map

Position competitors on two key dimensions relevant to the market:
- Y-Axis: [e.g., Enterprise vs. SMB]
- X-Axis: [e.g., Simple vs. Comprehensive]

**Whitespace Opportunities**: [Underserved segments]

### 6. Win/Loss Analysis

**Why We Win:**
- Better at: [specific capabilities]
- Customers who value: [what matters to them]

**Why We Lose:**
- When customers need: [specific requirements]
- Their advantage: [what tips the decision]

### 7. Strategic Recommendations

**Immediate Actions (0-3 months):**
1. [Action] — [Rationale]

**Medium-term (3-12 months):**
1. [Action] — [Rationale]

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not present competitor feature claims as facts without citing a source or flagging them as assumptions — outdated or incorrect feature data misleads sales and product decisions
- [ ] Do not build a competitive analysis that only covers features — pricing, messaging, go-to-market motion, and who they hire for are equally strategic signals
- [ ] Do not treat all buyers as identical — the same product may win against Competitor A in the enterprise segment and lose in SMB; segment-specific win/loss matters
- [ ] Do not soften weaknesses and threats in the SWOT to avoid internal discomfort — an honest SWOT is only useful if the negatives are real

## Quality Checks

- [ ] All competitor claims cite a source or are flagged as assumptions
- [ ] Feature comparison notes quality differences, not just feature presence
- [ ] Strategic recommendations are specific actions, not generic advice
- [ ] Win/loss analysis reflects customer perspective, not internal assumptions
- [ ] Different customer segments are considered (not all buyers value the same things)
