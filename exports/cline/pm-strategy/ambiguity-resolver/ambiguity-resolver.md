# Ambiguity Resolver Skill

Turn vague briefs and half-formed opportunities into structured, actionable problem statements — so you can reply with clarity instead of asking for three more meetings.

## Required Inputs

Ask the user for these if not provided:
- **The vague brief or opportunity description** (even a single sentence is enough)
- **Who asked for this** (stakeholder context shapes the framing)
- **Known constraints** (timeline, budget, team size — if any are known)

## Three-Stage Process

### Stage 1: Reframe
- Restate the vague input as 3-5 explicit questions that need answering
- Identify the unstated assumptions hidden in the brief
- Surface the real decision this feeds into (what will someone do differently once this is resolved?)

### Stage 2: Scope
- Define what is explicitly IN scope
- Define what is explicitly OUT of scope (equally important)
- Identify the deadline pressure: is this urgent/important, important/not urgent, or unclear?
- Name who owns the final decision and who needs to be consulted

### Stage 3: Action
- Define the minimum viable research: 2-3 activities maximum that would give enough signal to move forward with confidence
- Time estimate for each activity
- What each activity would tell you (and what it wouldn't)
- Proposed check-in point: when to regroup before committing to more

**Validate** — Confirm every reframed question maps to at least one research activity. Verify scope boundaries are specific enough to say "no" to something concrete.

## Output Structure

### Problem Brief: [Opportunity Area]

**Restated as questions:**
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

**Unstated assumptions we should surface:**
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]

**In scope:** [Clear boundary]
**Out of scope:** [Clear boundary]
**Decision owner:** [Name/role]
**Timeline:** [Real deadline if known, or "unclear — recommend setting one"]

**Minimum viable research:**
| Activity | Time required | What it tells us | What it won't tell us |
|----------|--------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| [activity] | [time] | [insight] | [limitation] |

**Proposed check-in:** After [activity], regroup to decide whether to proceed or pivot.

## Example (Partial)

Input: *"We need to figure out what to do about our enterprise customers."*

**Restated as questions:**
1. Are enterprise customers churning, underperforming on expansion, or both?
2. Is this a product gap, a support/service gap, or a pricing/packaging issue?
3. What does "do something" look like — a new initiative, a policy change, or a resource shift?

**In scope:** Enterprise accounts ($50K+ ARR) showing declining health scores in the last two quarters
**Out of scope:** SMB segment, new enterprise acquisition strategy

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not reframe the brief into questions that are still too broad to research — each reframed question must be answerable by a specific activity
- [ ] Do not list a research activity without stating what it would tell you and what it would NOT tell you
- [ ] Do not leave the decision owner as "leadership" or "the team" — name a specific person or role
- [ ] Do not omit an explicit out-of-scope boundary — without it, scope will expand organically and the brief becomes meaningless

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Every reframed question is specific enough to research (not "how do we improve things?")
- [ ] Scope boundaries name something concrete that is excluded
- [ ] Research activities are achievable within the stated timeline
- [ ] Decision owner is identified (not "leadership" — a specific person or role)
