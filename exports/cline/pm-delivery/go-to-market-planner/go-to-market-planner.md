# Go-to-Market Planner Skill

Produce a complete, cross-functional GTM plan that aligns product, marketing, sales, and support around a single launch — with clear owners, timelines, and success metrics.

## Launch Tier Framework

Before planning, classify the launch:

| Tier | Scope | Typical Effort | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 — Major Launch** | New product / significant platform change | 8–12 weeks | New pricing model, platform rebrand, new product line |
| **Tier 2 — Feature Launch** | Significant new capability | 4–6 weeks | Major feature, API release, new integration |
| **Tier 3 — Incremental Release** | Improvement, bug fix, minor feature | 1–2 weeks | UI tweak, performance improvement, small enhancement |

Always confirm tier with the user before proceeding.

## GTM Plan Output Format

### GTM Plan — [Product/Feature Name] — [Launch Date]

**Launch Tier:** [1 / 2 / 3]
**Launch Owner (PM):** [Name]
**Target Launch Date:** [Date]
**Soft Launch Date (Beta/Limited):** [Date, if applicable]

---

### 1. What We're Launching
**One-line description:** [What it is, for whom, and why now]
**Key customer problem solved:** [Specific pain point]
**Key differentiator:** [Why ours, why now]

---

### 2. Target Audience
**Primary segment:** [Who benefits most — be specific]
**Secondary segment:** [Who else benefits]
**Not for:** [Who this is NOT for — helps sales and support]

---

### 3. Messaging

**Headline:** [Customer-facing headline — lead with outcome, not feature]
**Sub-headline:** [Supporting context — how it works or why it matters]
**3 key messages:**
1. [Problem solved]
2. [How it works / what's new]
3. [Proof / social proof / data]

**Elevator pitch (30 seconds):**
> [For [target user] who [has this problem], [product/feature] is a [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternative], we [differentiator].]

### 7. Launch Day Checklist
- [ ] Feature live for [X%] of users
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard active
- [ ] Support team briefed
- [ ] Blog post published
- [ ] Email sent / scheduled
- [ ] Sales team notified
- [ ] Executive announcement sent (if Tier 1)
- [ ] Rollback procedure confirmed

## Required Inputs

Ask the user for these if not provided:
- **Product or feature name**
- **Target launch date**
- **Launch tier** (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 — or describe scope and the skill will classify)
- **Target audience** (who benefits and who it's NOT for)
- **Key message** (what's the headline outcome for the customer)
- **PM and launch owner**

## Guidelines

- Never plan a Tier 1 launch without at least 8 weeks of lead time
- Always include a "Not for" section — it prevents misdirected sales and support tickets
- Recommend a soft launch to 5–10% of users before full rollout for any Tier 1 or 2 launch
- Post-launch retrospective should be scheduled at launch planning time — don't leave it to chance

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Launch tier is confirmed and appropriate for scope
- [ ] "Not for" section is included to prevent misdirected sales and support
- [ ] Every function has at least one activity with a named owner and due date
- [ ] Success metrics include a measurement window (30/60/90 days)
- [ ] Rollback procedure is confirmed for Tier 1 and 2 launches
- [ ] Post-launch retrospective is scheduled

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not build a Tier 1 GTM plan for an incremental feature update — tier the launch appropriately before planning
- [ ] Do not create activity lists without named owners and due dates — unowned tasks do not get done
- [ ] Do not skip the rollback procedure for Tier 1 and 2 launches — every significant launch must have an abort plan
- [ ] Do not treat marketing and engineering as separate tracks — cross-functional coordination is the whole point of a GTM plan
- [ ] Do not set success metrics without a defined measurement window — "increase signups" is not a measurable target
