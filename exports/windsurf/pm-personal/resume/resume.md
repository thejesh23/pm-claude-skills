# Resume Skill

A resume gets ~7 seconds and an ATS scan before a human reads it. So it has to be *scannable*,
*achievement-led*, and *keyword-aligned* — not a job-description recap. This skill turns your experience
into quantified accomplishment bullets, structured single-column (ATS-safe), and tailored to the target
role. Export it with the **Paper** or **Modern** PDF theme for a typeset result.

## Working from a brief

You will often get rough notes, a partial history, or just a target role. **Always deliver a complete,
ready-to-use resume anyway** — do not stop to ask questions and do not leave bracketed placeholders like
`[Company]` or `[add metric]`. Where a detail is missing, infer a specific, realistic one from the rest of
the brief and the target role, and mark anything you inferred *(assumed — confirm)* so the user knows to
verify it. A concrete, labelled assumption always beats a blank or a clarifying question.

Quantify every achievement: if the user gave a real number, use it; if not, turn the duty into an
achievement with a **defensible, clearly-framed estimate** *(assumed — confirm)* rather than leaving it as a
responsibility. Never silently fabricate or inflate numbers on a real person's resume — an unmarked
invented metric is the one thing worse than a missing one.

## Inputs (infer any not provided — label assumptions)

- **Target role / job description** — so the resume is tailored and keyword-aligned (generic resumes lose).
- **Your experience** — roles, dates, and what you did/achieved (rough notes fine; the skill quantifies them).
- **Skills, tools, education, certifications.**
- **Seniority & format preference** — reverse-chronological (default) vs. functional; one page (most) vs. two.

## Output Format

A single-column, ATS-friendly resume in this order:

### [Full Name]
[Target title] · [city / remote] · [email] · [phone] · [LinkedIn/portfolio]

**Summary** — 2–3 lines: who you are, your strongest proof, and what you're targeting. No "results-driven professional" filler.

**Experience** — reverse-chronological. Per role:
**[Title]**, [Company] · [dates]
- [Accomplishment bullet: **action verb → what you did → quantified impact**]. e.g. "Cut onboarding drop-off 18%→9%, unlocking ~$140k ARR."
- 3–5 bullets per recent role, fewer for older ones. Achievements, not duties.

**Skills** — grouped, keyword-rich, mirroring the job's language (ATS matches on these).

**Education** — degree, institution, year; certifications.

**Tailoring note** (separate, for the user): which of the job's keywords you wove in, and any gap to address in the cover letter.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Every experience bullet is an **achievement with a metric**, not a duty ("responsible for…")
- [ ] Bullets start with strong action verbs; no first-person pronouns
- [ ] Single-column, standard headings, no tables/text-boxes/graphics that break ATS parsing
- [ ] Keywords from the target job description appear naturally (skills + bullets)
- [ ] Length fits seniority (1 page < ~10 yrs; 2 max); newest/most-relevant first
- [ ] Contact line is complete and the summary names the target role

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not list job duties — "managed a team" is a responsibility; "grew the team 4→11 and cut attrition 30%" is an achievement
- [ ] Do not use multi-column layouts, tables, headers/footers, or icons — they scramble in ATS parsers
- [ ] Do not write a generic resume — tailor the summary, skills, and emphasis to the target role
- [ ] Do not pad with soft-skill filler ("hard-working team player") — show it through results
- [ ] Do not invent or inflate metrics — use real numbers, or a defensible estimate clearly framed

## Based On

Achievement-led, ATS-aware resume practice (reverse-chronological, quantified-impact bullets, keyword alignment).
