const md = `# The State of Professional AI — ${edition} Edition

*Published ${today} by [the Open Institute for Professional Judgment](INSTITUTE.md). Every number below is reproducible: the instruments, raw data, and methods are open. Cite freely.*

## 1. The skill ecosystem (the census)

GitHub's public \`SKILL.md\` surface stands at roughly **${censusHeadline} files** — but conformance is a pyramid: in the graded sample, **${censusL1 || '~96'}% of public skills stop at "loadable"** (frontmatter only), with structured inputs/outputs and self-verification remaining rare. The gap between a prompt-with-a-filename and a dependable instrument is the ecosystem's defining quality problem — and it is checkable (\`npx skillspec-check\`).
*Full census: [${latestCensus || 'docs/reports/'}](${latestCensus || '.'}) — refreshed weekly by automation with a quality gate.*

## 2. Models on professional work (SkillBench)

${bench.runs.length ? bench.runs.map((r) => `- **${r.model}** — ${r.score}/5 skill-guided${r.bare != null ? ` vs ${r.bare}/5 bare (lift: ${r.lift ?? 'n/a'})` : ''} · ${String(r.date).slice(0, 10)}`).join('\n') : '- First cross-vendor runs pending.'}

The finding that matters: **the lift from skill-structure exceeds the gap between adjacent model tiers** — process discipline is worth more than a model upgrade at current margins. Frozen tasks, blind judging, transcripts published: [skillbench/](../../skillbench/).

## 3. The competition (the Season)

Season 1 — *${season ? season.title : 'n/a'}* — opened ${season ? season.opens : ''}: identical hidden state for every player on Earth, attested scores, a PR-reviewed leaderboard. Entries to date: **${lb.entries.length}**. ${lb.entries.length ? `Current leader: ${lb.entries.slice().sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)[0].name}.` : 'The board is open.'}

## 4. The library (this project as a specimen)

**${catalog.skills.length} skills · ${tiers.production} production / ${tiers.stable} stable / ${tiers.experimental} experimental — 100% at SkillSpec L3 (CI-enforced).** ${last.stars ? `${last.stars} GitHub stars.` : ''} The free-runs ledger (sponsor-funded, counts only): **${last.runs ?? 'n/a'} runs served** across ${vitals.length} recorded days${first.runs != null && last.runs != null ? ` (+${last.runs - first.runs} in the period)` : ''}.

## 5. The year's theses

1. **Verification became the differentiator.** Skills that state their own quality bar can be audited, benchmarked, and trusted; the census shows almost nobody does it yet. Expect L3-style self-verification to become table stakes.
2. **Judgment is measurable.** Attested arena scores, calibration curves, and blind-judged benchmarks put numbers on things résumés only claim. Credentials that can be *checked* will crowd out credentials that must be *believed*.
3. **The agent is the new junior colleague — and it needs an employee handbook.** The fastest-growing artifacts in this ecosystem aren't prompts; they're standards of work. That is what a skills library is.

---
*Methods: census via GitHub code search (approximations, honestly labeled); bench via frozen task sets with published judges; vitals from the public ledger branch. Regenerate: \`node scripts/build-annual-report.mjs\`.*
