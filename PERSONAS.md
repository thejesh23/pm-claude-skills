# 👤 Personas — curated role loadouts

> **A persona = a skill loadout + a workflow recipe + a subagent.** Pick the role closest to your job
> and you get the handful of skills to start with, the chained recipe for your most common end-to-end
> task, and (where one exists) a specialist subagent. It's the fastest way in — no scrolling 743 skills.

Personas drive the **"What do you do?"** chips in the [playground](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/)
and are defined once in [`web/personas.json`](web/personas.json). Use a loadout three ways:

- **Playground:** pick your role on first visit → your starter skills are featured.
- **Recipe:** run the persona's [Workflow Recipe](WORKFLOWS.md) to chain its skills end-to-end (in the [Canvas](https://mohitagw15856.github.io/pm-claude-skills/canvas.html) or as a `/slash-command`).
- **Subagent:** where listed, the [agent template](agents/) is a specialist you can delegate to in Claude Code.

**Add or edit a persona:** edit [`web/personas.json`](web/personas.json) (name, emoji, loadout, recipe, subagent). The playground onboarding and this table both read from it.
