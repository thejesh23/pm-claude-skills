# Code Review Checklist Skill

Produces a tailored code review checklist for a specific pull request — scaled to the language, type of change, and risk level. Not a generic template.

## Required Inputs

Ask the user for these if not provided:
- **Language and framework** (e.g. TypeScript + React / Python + FastAPI / Go)
- **Type of change** (feature / bug fix / refactor / dependency upgrade / security patch / performance)
- **Risk level** (low / medium / high / critical)
- **PR description** (paste the description or link to the PR)
- **Author context** (new starter / experienced / external contributor)

## Output Format

# Code Review: [PR Title or Reference]

**Scope assessment:** [Small / Medium / Large / Too large — should be split]
**Recommended review depth:** [Skim / Standard / Deep dive]
**Estimated review time:** [Minutes]

### 2. Correctness Checks

Language-specific correctness checks — choose based on the language stated:

**For TypeScript/JavaScript:**
- Type definitions match actual usage
- No implicit `any` in non-test code
- Async/await used consistently; no unhandled promises
- Null/undefined handling is explicit

**For Python:**
- Type hints present on public functions
- Exception handling is specific (no bare except)
- Resources are closed (context managers, with blocks)

**For Go:**
- Errors are handled or explicitly ignored with a comment
- Context propagation is correct
- Goroutine lifetimes are bounded

[Include only the section matching the stated language]

### 3. Change-Type-Specific Checks

**For bug fixes:**
- A test exists that would have caught this bug
- The fix addresses root cause, not symptom
- Related code paths checked for the same issue

**For features:**
- Acceptance criteria met
- Edge cases handled (empty, large, concurrent)
- Error paths tested, not just happy path
- Telemetry/logging added for debugging

**For refactors:**
- Behaviour unchanged (tests still pass)
- No scope creep — refactor only
- Complexity reduced, not just moved

**For dependency upgrades:**
- Breaking changes reviewed
- Security advisories checked
- License compatibility verified

[Include only the section matching the stated change type]

### 4. Risk-Appropriate Checks

**Low risk:** basic correctness, style conventions, test coverage
**Medium risk:** above + rollback plan, monitoring updates, performance considerations
**High risk:** above + security implications, data migration safety, feature flag/gradual rollout
**Critical risk:** above + staging validation plan, incident response plan, post-deploy verification checklist

### 5. Testing Adequacy
- Unit tests cover new logic
- Integration tests cover the contract changes
- Edge cases tested
- Failure modes tested
- Performance tests if performance-sensitive

### 6. Review Decision Framework

**Approve if:** [2-3 specific conditions based on this PR]
**Request changes if:** [Specific blockers]
**Comment (non-blocking) if:** [Items worth discussing but not blocking merge]

### 7. Common Pitfalls for This Change Type
Based on the change type and language, flag 2-3 things reviewers typically miss for this combination.
