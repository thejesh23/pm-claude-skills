# i18n Readiness Review Skill

Localizing a product that isn't *internationalized* fails expensively — translators hit hard-coded
strings, layouts break on longer languages, dates show in the wrong format, and RTL shatters the UI.
i18n is the engineering groundwork; localization is the content. This skill audits whether the product
is ready, so you fix the foundations *before* paying to translate into the cracks.

## Required Inputs

Ask for these only if they aren't already provided:

- **The product** — web/app/codebase, stack/framework (i18n tooling differs).
- **Target languages** — especially if any need RTL (Arabic/Hebrew), CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean), or are long (German/Finnish).
- **What you can share** — code snippets, UI screenshots, or a description of how strings/formatting are handled today.

## Output Format

### i18n Readiness: [product]

A readiness audit across the dimensions that break localization, each with status (🟢 ready / 🟡 partial / 🔴 blocker) and the fix:

| Dimension | Check | Status | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| **String externalization** | no user-facing text hard-coded; all in resource files / i18n keys | | move strings to a catalog; no concatenated sentences |
| **Formatting** | dates, numbers, currency, plurals via locale-aware libs (Intl/ICU) | | use Intl/ICU; never string-format dates |
| **Pluralization** | plural rules handled (not `count + " items"`) | | ICU plural categories (some langs have 4–6) |
| **Layout/expansion** | UI tolerates ~+30–40% text length; no fixed-width truncation | | flexible layouts, no text baked into images |
| **Encoding** | UTF-8 throughout; CJK renders | | UTF-8 end to end |
| **RTL** | layout mirrors for right-to-left scripts | | logical CSS properties, dir attribute |
| **Locale plumbing** | locale selection, fallback, and persistence exist | | a locale resolver + fallback chain |
| **Assets/content** | images with text, examples, names are swappable | | externalize locale-specific assets |

**Prioritised fixes** — the blockers (🔴) first (hard-coded strings, no Intl formatting, broken RTL), then 🟡s. These must land **before** translation begins, or you translate into a broken foundation.

**Verdict** — ready to localize / fix-blockers-first / not yet, in one line.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Checks string externalization (the #1 blocker) — no hard-coded or concatenated UI text
- [ ] Verifies locale-aware formatting (Intl/ICU) for dates, numbers, currency, plurals
- [ ] Assesses layout expansion (+30–40%) and RTL if a target needs it
- [ ] Confirms UTF-8 / CJK encoding end to end
- [ ] Prioritises blockers to fix *before* translation starts
- [ ] Ends with a clear ready / not-ready verdict

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not start translating before i18n is ready — you'll translate into hard-coded strings and broken layouts
- [ ] Do not concatenate sentence fragments — word order differs by language; translate whole strings with placeholders
- [ ] Do not string-format dates/numbers — use Intl/ICU, or every locale shows them wrong
- [ ] Do not assume text length — German/Finnish expand; fixed-width UI truncates and clips
- [ ] Do not ignore RTL until late — retrofitting right-to-left into a left-to-right layout is a rebuild, not a tweak

## Based On

Internationalization engineering practice — string externalization, ICU/Intl formatting & plurals, text expansion, RTL, UTF-8.
