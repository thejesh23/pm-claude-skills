# TDD Workflow Skill

The failure mode of AI-assisted coding is writing a pile of code, then maybe some tests that rubber-stamp it.
TDD inverts that: the test defines the behavior *first*, the code does the minimum to pass, then you refactor
safely. This skill runs that loop with discipline — **one small red-green-refactor cycle at a time**, never
jumping ahead to untested code.

## Required Inputs

Ask for these only if they aren't already provided:

- **The behavior to build** — the feature/bugfix, stated as observable behavior (input → expected output).
- **The stack** — language, test framework/runner, where tests live.
- **The seam** — the function/module/endpoint under test, and any collaborators to fake/mock.
- **Edge cases** — the conditions that matter (errors, empty, boundaries).

## Output Format

### TDD plan: [behavior]

**Behavior list** — the observable cases to drive out, ordered simplest → richest (happy path first, then edges/errors). Each becomes one cycle.

Then, for **each cycle** (do them one at a time, smallest first):

**🔴 Red** — the single failing test to write now (the actual test code), and *why it fails* (the behavior doesn't exist yet). One assertion of one behavior.

**🟢 Green** — the *minimal* code to make exactly that test pass — even if it's obvious/ugly. No extra features, no speculative generality.

**🔵 Refactor** — what to clean up now that it's green (naming, duplication, structure) with the test as the safety net. Skip if nothing's needed.

**Run** — the command to run the test(s) and what "passing" looks like.

End with: the next cycle's red test, and a note to commit at each green.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Behaviors are listed and ordered simplest-first; each cycle tests ONE behavior
- [ ] The red step writes a genuinely failing test *before* any implementation
- [ ] The green step is the minimal code to pass — no untested extra functionality
- [ ] Refactoring happens only on green, with tests as the safety net
- [ ] Edge/error cases each get their own cycle, not bolted onto the happy path

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not write the implementation first and the test after — that's not TDD, it's rationalization
- [ ] Do not write five tests then all the code — one red→green→refactor cycle at a time
- [ ] Do not over-build in green — only enough to pass the current test
- [ ] Do not test implementation details — test observable behavior so refactors don't break tests
- [ ] Do not skip the refactor step when there's obvious duplication or a bad name

## Based On

Test-Driven Development (Kent Beck): red → green → refactor, triangulation, one behavior per cycle.
