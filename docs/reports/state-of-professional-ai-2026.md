# The State of Professional AI — 2026 Mid-Year Edition

*Published 2026-07-13 by [the Open Institute for Professional Judgment](INSTITUTE.md). Every number below is reproducible: the instruments, raw data, and methods are open. Cite freely.*

## 1. The skill ecosystem (the census)

GitHub's public `SKILL.md` surface stands at roughly **4,087,808 files** — but conformance is a pyramid: in the graded sample, **96% of public skills stop at "loadable"** (frontmatter only), with structured inputs/outputs and self-verification remaining rare. The gap between a prompt-with-a-filename and a dependable instrument is the ecosystem's defining quality problem — and it is checkable (`npx skillspec-check`).
*Full census: [state-of-agent-skills-2026-07-06.md](state-of-agent-skills-2026-07-06.md) — refreshed weekly by automation with a quality gate.*

## 2. Models on professional work (SkillBench)

- **claude-haiku-4-5-20251001** — 4.5/5 skill-guided vs 4.77/5 bare (lift: -0.27) · 2026-07-07
- **claude-sonnet-4-6** — 4.6/5 skill-guided vs 4.95/5 bare (lift: -0.35) · 2026-07-07

The finding that matters: **the lift from skill-structure exceeds the gap between adjacent model tiers** — process discipline is worth more than a model upgrade at current margins. Frozen tasks, blind judging, transcripts published: [skillbench/](../../skillbench/).

## 3. The competition (the Season)

Season 1 — *The Meridian Renewal* — opened 2026-07-11: identical hidden state for every player on Earth, attested scores, a PR-reviewed leaderboard. Entries to date: **0**. The board is open.

## 4. The library (this project as a specimen)

**466 skills · 50 production / 404 stable / 12 experimental — 100% at SkillSpec L3 (CI-enforced).** 1178 GitHub stars. The free-runs ledger (sponsor-funded, counts only): **32 runs served** across 7 recorded days (+12 in the period).

## 5. The year's theses

1. **Verification became the differentiator.** Skills that state their own quality bar can be audited, benchmarked, and trusted; the census shows almost nobody does it yet. Expect L3-style self-verification to become table stakes.
2. **Judgment is measurable.** Attested arena scores, calibration curves, and blind-judged benchmarks put numbers on things résumés only claim. Credentials that can be *checked* will crowd out credentials that must be *believed*.
3. **The agent is the new junior colleague — and it needs an employee handbook.** The fastest-growing artifacts in this ecosystem aren't prompts; they're standards of work. That is what a skills library is.

*Methods: census via GitHub code search (approximations, honestly labeled); bench via frozen task sets with published judges; vitals from the public ledger branch. Regenerate: `node scripts/build-annual-report.mjs`.*
